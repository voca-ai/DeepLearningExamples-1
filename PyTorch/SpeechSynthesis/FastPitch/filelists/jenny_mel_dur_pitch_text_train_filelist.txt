mels/02234.pt|durations/02234.pt|pitch_char/02234.pt|Well maybe I am a little.
mels/06780.pt|durations/06780.pt|pitch_char/06780.pt|The man, having a brief authority, parted with him.
mels/02028.pt|durations/02028.pt|pitch_char/02028.pt|wasn't even her major!
mels/02451.pt|durations/02451.pt|pitch_char/02451.pt|No no. That would be me again. I'm just trying something.
mels/06612.pt|durations/06612.pt|pitch_char/06612.pt|Good if so far we live in them when gone!
mels/04429.pt|durations/04429.pt|pitch_char/04429.pt|We'll talk about something else now, I think.
mels/00055.pt|durations/00055.pt|pitch_char/00055.pt|What occupation has been advised to you?
mels/02268.pt|durations/02268.pt|pitch_char/02268.pt|Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys. That's a good one! Hey.
mels/05077.pt|durations/05077.pt|pitch_char/05077.pt|She looked at me wildly, with a cry of terror.
mels/04970.pt|durations/04970.pt|pitch_char/04970.pt|Hi, friend!
mels/03093.pt|durations/03093.pt|pitch_char/03093.pt|I'm working tomorrow
mels/02059.pt|durations/02059.pt|pitch_char/02059.pt|What a neat idea! All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
mels/02507.pt|durations/02507.pt|pitch_char/02507.pt|I'm not.
mels/05197.pt|durations/05197.pt|pitch_char/05197.pt|She was the right sort of woman, your mother!
mels/02313.pt|durations/02313.pt|pitch_char/02313.pt|I'm doing new material tonight.
mels/04983.pt|durations/04983.pt|pitch_char/04983.pt|He was strongly and painfully impressed by what he had heard.
mels/05757.pt|durations/05757.pt|pitch_char/05757.pt|Once more I made the experiment: she snapped at me like a dog, and bit me.
mels/02831.pt|durations/02831.pt|pitch_char/02831.pt|I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down. No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
mels/05011.pt|durations/05011.pt|pitch_char/05011.pt|But the Whigs were a small and a disheartened minority.
mels/05759.pt|durations/05759.pt|pitch_char/05759.pt|Brother and sister were bound together by an extreme affection.
mels/01026.pt|durations/01026.pt|pitch_char/01026.pt|The second guy. I see.
mels/02274.pt|durations/02274.pt|pitch_char/02274.pt|Thank you.
mels/04106.pt|durations/04106.pt|pitch_char/04106.pt|And who thinks the worse of him for it?
mels/05815.pt|durations/05815.pt|pitch_char/05815.pt|Mr. Dale gulped a ball in his throat.

mels/02468.pt|durations/02468.pt|pitch_char/02468.pt|Have you suffered from any consequences or complications?
mels/04788.pt|durations/04788.pt|pitch_char/04788.pt|So there you are. Other men and boys saw the point and followed.
mels/05315.pt|durations/05315.pt|pitch_char/05315.pt|It was a marvellous guess. But it was a reflection only.
mels/01254.pt|durations/01254.pt|pitch_char/01254.pt|Is that what this is about? No no. I was just wondering.
mels/03015.pt|durations/03015.pt|pitch_char/03015.pt|How many flights did you have in the last two months?
mels/02772.pt|durations/02772.pt|pitch_char/02772.pt|I guess this belongs to you. Or maybe some day Mindy. Like she'd settle for that.
mels/04278.pt|durations/04278.pt|pitch_char/04278.pt|But Calvin wished to destroy caste AMONG the clergy, and consequently spiritual tyranny.
mels/00025.pt|durations/00025.pt|pitch_char/00025.pt|This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
mels/05283.pt|durations/05283.pt|pitch_char/05283.pt|Forgive me then! That would be very SIMPLE, and it would be economical.
mels/05656.pt|durations/05656.pt|pitch_char/05656.pt|Seen her? One of the old fashioned kind.
mels/06594.pt|durations/06594.pt|pitch_char/06594.pt|What ails her at all? More reluctantly the boy obeyed.
mels/04510.pt|durations/04510.pt|pitch_char/04510.pt|What are you going to send to the Salon?
mels/05485.pt|durations/05485.pt|pitch_char/05485.pt|And now she's sweet on him after he's dead.
mels/00181.pt|durations/00181.pt|pitch_char/00181.pt|Most women would kill
mels/05809.pt|durations/05809.pt|pitch_char/05809.pt|They smiled among themselves, but made no answer.
mels/02330.pt|durations/02330.pt|pitch_char/02330.pt|All right once
mels/04862.pt|durations/04862.pt|pitch_char/04862.pt|Her letters?
mels/06669.pt|durations/06669.pt|pitch_char/06669.pt|What does your question mean? The suggestion I offered amounted briefly to this.
mels/06274.pt|durations/06274.pt|pitch_char/06274.pt|No, sir, you won't! He was tried, convicted, and sentenced.
mels/06583.pt|durations/06583.pt|pitch_char/06583.pt|Perhaps we shall meet again. Might not this turn the scale AGAINST them?
mels/00700.pt|durations/00700.pt|pitch_char/00700.pt|Do you still have symptoms or complaints due to the disorder?
mels/04858.pt|durations/04858.pt|pitch_char/04858.pt|She preferred to receive CATHERINE and her daughter at home.
mels/00632.pt|durations/00632.pt|pitch_char/00632.pt|Do you still have symptoms and complications?
mels/04932.pt|durations/04932.pt|pitch_char/04932.pt|It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
mels/00112.pt|durations/00112.pt|pitch_char/00112.pt|And then he woke up and there was this big plant
mels/03530.pt|durations/03530.pt|pitch_char/03530.pt|What letter?
mels/05713.pt|durations/05713.pt|pitch_char/05713.pt|Between seven and eight next morning, he presented HIMSELF again at the office.
mels/02023.pt|durations/02023.pt|pitch_char/02023.pt|We got the proofs from the shoot with the vegetables. I blew off the afternoon. I went shopping.
mels/05321.pt|durations/05321.pt|pitch_char/05321.pt|Nothing in this universe seemed quite natural to Michael Moon.
mels/04728.pt|durations/04728.pt|pitch_char/04728.pt|Will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?
mels/03599.pt|durations/03599.pt|pitch_char/03599.pt|And what shall I do to earn your bounty, lady?
mels/00170.pt|durations/00170.pt|pitch_char/00170.pt|When did hospitalisation and or or rehabilitation take place?
mels/05398.pt|durations/05398.pt|pitch_char/05398.pt|I have heard him even spoken of as a philanthropist.
mels/01396.pt|durations/01396.pt|pitch_char/01396.pt|That's all right, dear. Here you go.
mels/02092.pt|durations/02092.pt|pitch_char/02092.pt|When did you receive official authorization for working with explosives?
mels/06646.pt|durations/06646.pt|pitch_char/06646.pt|I only came in the day before yesterday.
mels/00098.pt|durations/00098.pt|pitch_char/00098.pt|How often have you undergone surgery?
mels/04095.pt|durations/04095.pt|pitch_char/04095.pt|In the silence of the night her voice was UNUSUALLY clear and distinct.
mels/03552.pt|durations/03552.pt|pitch_char/03552.pt|Upon it was painted a wonderful picture. Second, increased development of scientific studies.
mels/02362.pt|durations/02362.pt|pitch_char/02362.pt|That's all you wanted to ask? That's all. What? That's not all.
mels/03368.pt|durations/03368.pt|pitch_char/03368.pt|There are forty chickens here. But the result justified him.
mels/06204.pt|durations/06204.pt|pitch_char/06204.pt|During the six working days no creature was slain.
mels/04573.pt|durations/04573.pt|pitch_char/04573.pt|He seems to dread taking the slightest advantage.
mels/05718.pt|durations/05718.pt|pitch_char/05718.pt|Oh hark!
mels/05167.pt|durations/05167.pt|pitch_char/05167.pt|Winter passed.
mels/00163.pt|durations/00163.pt|pitch_char/00163.pt|Yeah. Could I take her?
mels/00234.pt|durations/00234.pt|pitch_char/00234.pt|Please state the condition of the person with such disease
mels/00273.pt|durations/00273.pt|pitch_char/00273.pt|who thinks things are other things. When the phone rings and she takes a shower.
mels/05117.pt|durations/05117.pt|pitch_char/05117.pt|She did not mean it. What kind of bird may it be, pray?
mels/02886.pt|durations/02886.pt|pitch_char/02886.pt|Well I I could live without it. Oh, you do, do you?
mels/04461.pt|durations/04461.pt|pitch_char/04461.pt|I'll take it with me.
mels/06435.pt|durations/06435.pt|pitch_char/06435.pt|He folded his hands, trembling. She looked at me as she took them.
mels/02054.pt|durations/02054.pt|pitch_char/02054.pt|I can't believe you moved the green ottoman.
mels/03092.pt|durations/03092.pt|pitch_char/03092.pt|For how long have you been unable to work?
mels/01380.pt|durations/01380.pt|pitch_char/01380.pt|What treatment do you take for your diabetes?
mels/02102.pt|durations/02102.pt|pitch_char/02102.pt|Ring, damn it, ring. Thanks. You know our phone's not working? What?
mels/03072.pt|durations/03072.pt|pitch_char/03072.pt|What's wrong? Why so scrunchie?
mels/02258.pt|durations/02258.pt|pitch_char/02258.pt|Please describe you martial arts activities
mels/03911.pt|durations/03911.pt|pitch_char/03911.pt|He thought even as things were they could certainly fight for a year.
mels/05808.pt|durations/05808.pt|pitch_char/05808.pt|Personally I was a little hazy and uncertain.
mels/01544.pt|durations/01544.pt|pitch_char/01544.pt|She's too much for me in bed.
mels/03706.pt|durations/03706.pt|pitch_char/03706.pt|What had I been saying to displease you? I only half comprehend her.
mels/00091.pt|durations/00091.pt|pitch_char/00091.pt|I see you moved the green ottoman. How did that happen?
mels/06477.pt|durations/06477.pt|pitch_char/06477.pt|When he made it! You did; but you don't now.
mels/06659.pt|durations/06659.pt|pitch_char/06659.pt|But I don't mind his beginning by liking me.
mels/03321.pt|durations/03321.pt|pitch_char/03321.pt|If you want, I'll break it off with her. No, don't do that. Not for me.
mels/02075.pt|durations/02075.pt|pitch_char/02075.pt|Yes! Did you see that? You were incredible.
mels/04594.pt|durations/04594.pt|pitch_char/04594.pt|Let me do her justice, if I can.
mels/00154.pt|durations/00154.pt|pitch_char/00154.pt|Focus? There's nothing to focus on.
mels/01463.pt|durations/01463.pt|pitch_char/01463.pt|I'm gonna ask once, and I want a straight answer.
mels/04661.pt|durations/04661.pt|pitch_char/04661.pt|A phenomenon to which "well drilled" policemen are no strangers. Inspector Jacks shrugged his shoulders. Perhaps it was not altogether his fault.
mels/02820.pt|durations/02820.pt|pitch_char/02820.pt|Your sister stood me up the other night. You got a minute?
mels/04323.pt|durations/04323.pt|pitch_char/04323.pt|Now you come, Mary Judson!
mels/03360.pt|durations/03360.pt|pitch_char/03360.pt|Gaston stopped. O hugely shameless! The time passed slowly.
mels/02353.pt|durations/02353.pt|pitch_char/02353.pt|Look I gotta tell you something. I have a wife. I have a job. I'm your congressman.
mels/00143.pt|durations/00143.pt|pitch_char/00143.pt|See how he was sweating when he walked out?
mels/02548.pt|durations/02548.pt|pitch_char/02548.pt|Or I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring. You've got Carol tomorrow.
mels/03733.pt|durations/03733.pt|pitch_char/03733.pt|And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
mels/05616.pt|durations/05616.pt|pitch_char/05616.pt|I will put earth in the coffin, reverend Mother.
mels/04690.pt|durations/04690.pt|pitch_char/04690.pt|After her, after her. I'm afraid we can do nothing against such a number.
mels/00019.pt|durations/00019.pt|pitch_char/00019.pt|At least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.
mels/05892.pt|durations/05892.pt|pitch_char/05892.pt|Look at the timber on it. And you had no reason.
mels/03197.pt|durations/03197.pt|pitch_char/03197.pt|Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn!
mels/00871.pt|durations/00871.pt|pitch_char/00871.pt|Shut up Joey!
mels/04404.pt|durations/04404.pt|pitch_char/04404.pt|Here he was able, but there played the Fire.
mels/04677.pt|durations/04677.pt|pitch_char/04677.pt|He was handsome; so correctly handsome, that a slight unfriendly touch precipitated him into caricature.
mels/06174.pt|durations/06174.pt|pitch_char/06174.pt|His face frightened her, and she lied vehemently.
mels/01309.pt|durations/01309.pt|pitch_char/01309.pt|Yeah. If we put our heads together, between the two of us
mels/02775.pt|durations/02775.pt|pitch_char/02775.pt|Is it something you'd like to share with the group?
mels/02850.pt|durations/02850.pt|pitch_char/02850.pt|What is or was the method of treatment?
mels/02549.pt|durations/02549.pt|pitch_char/02549.pt|Are there further loans?
mels/03476.pt|durations/03476.pt|pitch_char/03476.pt|She was mistaken in part.
mels/00880.pt|durations/00880.pt|pitch_char/00880.pt|Whatever you want.
mels/00718.pt|durations/00718.pt|pitch_char/00718.pt|Actually, it's quite typical behavior
mels/01098.pt|durations/01098.pt|pitch_char/01098.pt|Come on, we're great together. Why not?
mels/04506.pt|durations/04506.pt|pitch_char/04506.pt|Yet for genuine excitement and thrill, give me the small boat.
mels/02163.pt|durations/02163.pt|pitch_char/02163.pt|No, I'm fine. Thanks. See you.
mels/05174.pt|durations/05174.pt|pitch_char/05174.pt|Then Tom May brought their thoughts back to the reason of the visit.
mels/03401.pt|durations/03401.pt|pitch_char/03401.pt|Yet of one THING we may be glad.
mels/06517.pt|durations/06517.pt|pitch_char/06517.pt|A prisoner took my measure for a suit of clothes.
mels/04503.pt|durations/04503.pt|pitch_char/04503.pt|Yes, madam; but my lady did not see that part.
mels/02209.pt|durations/02209.pt|pitch_char/02209.pt|Can I use either thumb? All right. Don't tell me.
mels/06552.pt|durations/06552.pt|pitch_char/06552.pt|No indeed I am not.
mels/01020.pt|durations/01020.pt|pitch_char/01020.pt|Did this disorder occur several times?
mels/06263.pt|durations/06263.pt|pitch_char/06263.pt|What I heard was the groan of a dying animal.
mels/03421.pt|durations/03421.pt|pitch_char/03421.pt|They keep chopping and changing their bits of land.
mels/06224.pt|durations/06224.pt|pitch_char/06224.pt|There was a troubled expression in her eyes.
mels/03301.pt|durations/03301.pt|pitch_char/03301.pt|That's what you've been working on for two hours? Go away. Stop looking in here.
mels/00898.pt|durations/00898.pt|pitch_char/00898.pt|What's going on? Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
mels/05134.pt|durations/05134.pt|pitch_char/05134.pt|I have been seeing THEIR intimacy with the greatest pleasure.
mels/06233.pt|durations/06233.pt|pitch_char/06233.pt|Shall prove to monsters, spoiling of their joys.
mels/01767.pt|durations/01767.pt|pitch_char/01767.pt|It was unbelievable! I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life!

mels/05839.pt|durations/05839.pt|pitch_char/05839.pt|This taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods.
mels/01427.pt|durations/01427.pt|pitch_char/01427.pt|Have you ever claimed for disability benefits?
mels/02071.pt|durations/02071.pt|pitch_char/02071.pt|When was your last attack?
mels/01624.pt|durations/01624.pt|pitch_char/01624.pt|You know what? What? There were times
mels/06456.pt|durations/06456.pt|pitch_char/06456.pt|But what are these compared with the sacred relics? Her very eyes were hungry.
mels/03481.pt|durations/03481.pt|pitch_char/03481.pt|I have seen a weakness in me that would have carried me anywhere.
mels/05183.pt|durations/05183.pt|pitch_char/05183.pt|You, my darling, have brought about this change in my life. All hail!

mels/03626.pt|durations/03626.pt|pitch_char/03626.pt|It was in this part that the tables for the suitors were laid.
mels/02403.pt|durations/02403.pt|pitch_char/02403.pt|You're one to talk.

mels/06093.pt|durations/06093.pt|pitch_char/06093.pt|But what in the world can I do?
mels/03993.pt|durations/03993.pt|pitch_char/03993.pt|I am glad you acted fairly by her.
mels/02970.pt|durations/02970.pt|pitch_char/02970.pt|See you.
mels/01899.pt|durations/01899.pt|pitch_char/01899.pt|Do you still suffer from the disorder?
mels/03443.pt|durations/03443.pt|pitch_char/03443.pt|He had suffered the family destiny without having shaped it.
mels/00047.pt|durations/00047.pt|pitch_char/00047.pt|A thumb? I know. I opened it and there it was
mels/03912.pt|durations/03912.pt|pitch_char/03912.pt|Then I let it fall again, and lo!
mels/02142.pt|durations/02142.pt|pitch_char/02142.pt|What was the other cause?
mels/04779.pt|durations/04779.pt|pitch_char/04779.pt|This logic stopped all argument. Oh serious square! Berlin, tom.
mels/04518.pt|durations/04518.pt|pitch_char/04518.pt|Intellect is, as some one has said, a sort of disease: it is incurable.
mels/01784.pt|durations/01784.pt|pitch_char/01784.pt|And I am late for keeping up with it, okay?
mels/05671.pt|durations/05671.pt|pitch_char/05671.pt|I thought the old wound had healed by this time.
mels/06516.pt|durations/06516.pt|pitch_char/06516.pt|My mother always left her small children in the care of the servants.
mels/03678.pt|durations/03678.pt|pitch_char/03678.pt|Have patience; all may yet go well. The Romans had assumed that charge.
mels/02467.pt|durations/02467.pt|pitch_char/02467.pt|Are you under regular medical supervision by a physician?
mels/04976.pt|durations/04976.pt|pitch_char/04976.pt|She smiled faintly while she fondled its silky, flapping ears.
mels/02657.pt|durations/02657.pt|pitch_char/02657.pt|Okay, but don't eat it till you get on the plane. Okay bye

mels/06213.pt|durations/06213.pt|pitch_char/06213.pt|I myself am of this nature. Weigh it.
mels/04529.pt|durations/04529.pt|pitch_char/04529.pt|To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman, it never will be.
mels/05753.pt|durations/05753.pt|pitch_char/05753.pt|"Yes," answered Barnum calmly, "but you may take the contracts for halls and printing off my hands at cost."
mels/06511.pt|durations/06511.pt|pitch_char/06511.pt|The woman detained him with her slow, light fingers.
mels/05465.pt|durations/05465.pt|pitch_char/05465.pt|And is not running a species of doing?
mels/01265.pt|durations/01265.pt|pitch_char/01265.pt|What are you doing? We're going to a hospital!
mels/01572.pt|durations/01572.pt|pitch_char/01572.pt|Have you had any lung function tests?
mels/00456.pt|durations/00456.pt|pitch_char/00456.pt|If you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. Welcome to the real world!
mels/03456.pt|durations/03456.pt|pitch_char/03456.pt|Moody pressed her hand significantly as it rested on his arm.
mels/00153.pt|durations/00153.pt|pitch_char/00153.pt|Is this other activity for pleasure only?
mels/01347.pt|durations/01347.pt|pitch_char/01347.pt|Which other medications are you taking?
mels/04692.pt|durations/04692.pt|pitch_char/04692.pt|"Mademoiselle," he said gravely, "once before, long ago, you permitted me to kiss you." They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment.
mels/05172.pt|durations/05172.pt|pitch_char/05172.pt|I'll kill you, you cur.
mels/06589.pt|durations/06589.pt|pitch_char/06589.pt|Absolutely nothing.
mels/04391.pt|durations/04391.pt|pitch_char/04391.pt|Then suddenly, without warning, we pitched over a little rise to the river.
mels/03561.pt|durations/03561.pt|pitch_char/03561.pt|And finish up by a collision with the sun!
mels/06123.pt|durations/06123.pt|pitch_char/06123.pt|No one would know it was a watch.
mels/04555.pt|durations/04555.pt|pitch_char/04555.pt|Was that my father that went hence so fast?
mels/04827.pt|durations/04827.pt|pitch_char/04827.pt|During the season a kind of fair was daily held near the fountain.
mels/05293.pt|durations/05293.pt|pitch_char/05293.pt|As to vowels, he scarcely considered them at all.
mels/03555.pt|durations/03555.pt|pitch_char/03555.pt|I do not think much of him. John Bellew did.
mels/06655.pt|durations/06655.pt|pitch_char/06655.pt|What a splendid city! The storms are coming.
mels/00782.pt|durations/00782.pt|pitch_char/00782.pt|What medications are you taking for the osteoporosis?
mels/06505.pt|durations/06505.pt|pitch_char/06505.pt|Listen to an old man; I am speaking quite seriously.
mels/04668.pt|durations/04668.pt|pitch_char/04668.pt|It was quite by his WISH that I went there.
mels/05141.pt|durations/05141.pt|pitch_char/05141.pt|But just about a week later a beautiful thing occurred.
mels/06180.pt|durations/06180.pt|pitch_char/06180.pt|He has an appointment that I know of for Saturday next.

mels/06782.pt|durations/06782.pt|pitch_char/06782.pt|Yes, you are indeed altered! Oh, I want to hug you!
mels/01744.pt|durations/01744.pt|pitch_char/01744.pt|So on our no date evening, three of you now have dates. And I met this really hot single mom at the store.
mels/03586.pt|durations/03586.pt|pitch_char/03586.pt|You be ready when I COME at seven.
mels/00675.pt|durations/00675.pt|pitch_char/00675.pt|And I don't have to. I know. You know?
mels/00599.pt|durations/00599.pt|pitch_char/00599.pt|This is my friend's machine.
mels/05148.pt|durations/05148.pt|pitch_char/05148.pt|Certainly not, he said. I didn't mean anything.
mels/01828.pt|durations/01828.pt|pitch_char/01828.pt|Does the knuckle cracking bother everybody, or just him?
mels/06128.pt|durations/06128.pt|pitch_char/06128.pt|Lying there, he heard the chase go panting by.
mels/05989.pt|durations/05989.pt|pitch_char/05989.pt|Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
mels/06643.pt|durations/06643.pt|pitch_char/06643.pt|You must play over some of these things to me.
mels/04743.pt|durations/04743.pt|pitch_char/04743.pt|Would she come to see me before I was killed?
mels/04515.pt|durations/04515.pt|pitch_char/04515.pt|This was also of a less fine quality. Antiochus the Great.
mels/01451.pt|durations/01451.pt|pitch_char/01451.pt|Okay. I'd just I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
mels/04554.pt|durations/04554.pt|pitch_char/04554.pt|He could love but once, and in one way only.
mels/05257.pt|durations/05257.pt|pitch_char/05257.pt|A new identity, which she might own anywhere!
mels/04820.pt|durations/04820.pt|pitch_char/04820.pt|When people are ill, they have such strange fancies!
mels/00822.pt|durations/00822.pt|pitch_char/00822.pt|That's pretty much it.
mels/04610.pt|durations/04610.pt|pitch_char/04610.pt|There were never any empty moments in my day.
mels/06314.pt|durations/06314.pt|pitch_char/06314.pt|How COULD the smallest comfort here be flowing?
mels/00278.pt|durations/00278.pt|pitch_char/00278.pt|No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. No, no, I ha I have to give you something.
mels/01931.pt|durations/01931.pt|pitch_char/01931.pt|You guys I am not that bad!
mels/04107.pt|durations/04107.pt|pitch_char/04107.pt|Beastly creature, I know not what to do with him.
mels/06575.pt|durations/06575.pt|pitch_char/06575.pt|Blunt, LEAD him hence; and see you guard him sure.
mels/01642.pt|durations/01642.pt|pitch_char/01642.pt|Have you attempted to commit suicide in the last ten years?
mels/03514.pt|durations/03514.pt|pitch_char/03514.pt|They say they send their dough to Petersburg.
mels/04220.pt|durations/04220.pt|pitch_char/04220.pt|I am afraid we should not think they were very nice people nowadays.
mels/00239.pt|durations/00239.pt|pitch_char/00239.pt|And the moment of joy is upon us.
mels/02736.pt|durations/02736.pt|pitch_char/02736.pt|Thank you so much. Stop. We'll talk later.
mels/06576.pt|durations/06576.pt|pitch_char/06576.pt|Can you meet me with the letters and other trifles?
mels/04420.pt|durations/04420.pt|pitch_char/04420.pt|I am glad I am not the child!
mels/06485.pt|durations/06485.pt|pitch_char/06485.pt|She called the maid back. Now let us sum up.
mels/04344.pt|durations/04344.pt|pitch_char/04344.pt|Go on.
mels/04815.pt|durations/04815.pt|pitch_char/04815.pt|We have finished with the witnesses in this hearing.
mels/00322.pt|durations/00322.pt|pitch_char/00322.pt|Oh not much. I got a job. That's great.
mels/01637.pt|durations/01637.pt|pitch_char/01637.pt|Of course I wanna sign you! Miss Leonard, I'm so Oh, boy.
mels/06742.pt|durations/06742.pt|pitch_char/06742.pt|We are here at peace. Do you mean you would keep me by force?
mels/02192.pt|durations/02192.pt|pitch_char/02192.pt|Now go away so we can talk about you.
mels/06520.pt|durations/06520.pt|pitch_char/06520.pt|Nothing worse? Then my shout reached her ears.
mels/05143.pt|durations/05143.pt|pitch_char/05143.pt|It is my duty also to know men and countries outside the empire.
mels/02777.pt|durations/02777.pt|pitch_char/02777.pt|I hope you can find some way to be happy for me.
mels/01485.pt|durations/01485.pt|pitch_char/01485.pt|I need help!
mels/02770.pt|durations/02770.pt|pitch_char/02770.pt|Has the tumour recurred?
mels/02206.pt|durations/02206.pt|pitch_char/02206.pt|And mean. And frightening.
mels/01405.pt|durations/01405.pt|pitch_char/01405.pt|Why don't I just join you both there? Apparently, they're attracted to dryer sheets.
mels/04570.pt|durations/04570.pt|pitch_char/04570.pt|I have to rely entirely upon your mercy.
mels/00350.pt|durations/00350.pt|pitch_char/00350.pt|What? And something else.
mels/01246.pt|durations/01246.pt|pitch_char/01246.pt|So I'll see you tomorrow.
mels/00465.pt|durations/00465.pt|pitch_char/00465.pt|What symptoms do you currently have?
mels/02100.pt|durations/02100.pt|pitch_char/02100.pt|Do you currently suffer from this condition?
mels/05017.pt|durations/05017.pt|pitch_char/05017.pt|Here are a thousand francs, bully that you are!
mels/06383.pt|durations/06383.pt|pitch_char/06383.pt|She told Emilia that she must leave her; her husband wished it. She was almost ferocious.
mels/04449.pt|durations/04449.pt|pitch_char/04449.pt|In short: We have confined ourselves long enough to the mere study of our legal canons.
mels/05503.pt|durations/05503.pt|pitch_char/05503.pt|He had had no thought save the thought of seeing Esther.
mels/02097.pt|durations/02097.pt|pitch_char/02097.pt|Now everything's screwed up.
mels/03437.pt|durations/03437.pt|pitch_char/03437.pt|I want your whole body. No humbug, eh?
mels/01586.pt|durations/01586.pt|pitch_char/01586.pt|What do you think? It's very clean. Really, it looks great!
mels/00191.pt|durations/00191.pt|pitch_char/00191.pt|Most people, when their pets pass on
mels/02504.pt|durations/02504.pt|pitch_char/02504.pt|What is the purpose of your travel or stay?

mels/06216.pt|durations/06216.pt|pitch_char/06216.pt|Sometimes men are infatuated, and write what they do not mean.
mels/03494.pt|durations/03494.pt|pitch_char/03494.pt|I inquires. But shift away: there's warrant in that theft Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.

mels/04167.pt|durations/04167.pt|pitch_char/04167.pt|There is with us. The times were troubled everywhere.
mels/02520.pt|durations/02520.pt|pitch_char/02520.pt|Stop it! Oh my God!
mels/02913.pt|durations/02913.pt|pitch_char/02913.pt|We can? Okay I'm trying that.
mels/00040.pt|durations/00040.pt|pitch_char/00040.pt|Please. That second time, you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup.
mels/01016.pt|durations/01016.pt|pitch_char/01016.pt|All right. Now, don't think of it as a cigarette.
mels/05263.pt|durations/05263.pt|pitch_char/05263.pt|It had not occurred to you to wonder? I was in for it now.
mels/01619.pt|durations/01619.pt|pitch_char/01619.pt|I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
mels/02767.pt|durations/02767.pt|pitch_char/02767.pt|Okay, here we go. Okay.
mels/01252.pt|durations/01252.pt|pitch_char/01252.pt|Will you help me? Please?
mels/01734.pt|durations/01734.pt|pitch_char/01734.pt|Now you're just tidying up. Okay. You want me to throw you? I can hop.
mels/04070.pt|durations/04070.pt|pitch_char/04070.pt|Yet now they fright me.
mels/04882.pt|durations/04882.pt|pitch_char/04882.pt|I followed with an open letter to many leading Democrats in the State.
mels/01378.pt|durations/01378.pt|pitch_char/01378.pt|Hold on. Fill these out. Sit over there! I don't want to make any trouble but I'm in a lot of pain.
mels/01703.pt|durations/01703.pt|pitch_char/01703.pt|But just barely and I. I've been talking about myself all night long. I'm sorry.
mels/01865.pt|durations/01865.pt|pitch_char/01865.pt|What is the percentage of the share capital the key person does own?
mels/05344.pt|durations/05344.pt|pitch_char/05344.pt|I thought she was here a minute ago.
mels/05629.pt|durations/05629.pt|pitch_char/05629.pt|I shall have enough left to reach the COUNTRY, by travelling on foot.
mels/03908.pt|durations/03908.pt|pitch_char/03908.pt|Indefinitely?

mels/00481.pt|durations/00481.pt|pitch_char/00481.pt|What type of surgery will be performed?
mels/02903.pt|durations/02903.pt|pitch_char/02903.pt|so then I figured maybe not.
mels/01429.pt|durations/01429.pt|pitch_char/01429.pt|but what the hell are you talking about? I mean, what about you? Me? I'm fine.
mels/06709.pt|durations/06709.pt|pitch_char/06709.pt|I've got to hold this job down a little longer.
mels/03458.pt|durations/03458.pt|pitch_char/03458.pt|That, he said, is a very just distinction.
mels/06035.pt|durations/06035.pt|pitch_char/06035.pt|What, on him? And where a tyrant sterner?
mels/00807.pt|durations/00807.pt|pitch_char/00807.pt|Let me ask you. What did you get?

mels/06338.pt|durations/06338.pt|pitch_char/06338.pt|I think you'd like him.

mels/03157.pt|durations/03157.pt|pitch_char/03157.pt|I don't wanna do that. I had the most supremely awful day.
mels/05785.pt|durations/05785.pt|pitch_char/05785.pt|I tried to make him.

mels/04239.pt|durations/04239.pt|pitch_char/04239.pt|Shepherds were seen running down from the mountains.
mels/04330.pt|durations/04330.pt|pitch_char/04330.pt|Won't you walk in? The woman seemed to shrink away.
mels/04006.pt|durations/04006.pt|pitch_char/04006.pt|Besides, I like trailing along, if you don't mind.
mels/05591.pt|durations/05591.pt|pitch_char/05591.pt|What if I were to try such and SUCH a thing?
mels/05202.pt|durations/05202.pt|pitch_char/05202.pt|He surveyed the crowd with cynical, dissatisfied eyes.
mels/02483.pt|durations/02483.pt|pitch_char/02483.pt|and saying it went to live on a farm.
mels/04026.pt|durations/04026.pt|pitch_char/04026.pt|Will that do? Under the name of a "republic" he erected a despotism and usurped powers such as no Russian autocrat would dare claim. Were we mistaken?
mels/02224.pt|durations/02224.pt|pitch_char/02224.pt|Always yelling. Nothing made him happy. Not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle.
mels/03247.pt|durations/03247.pt|pitch_char/03247.pt|And then you put your arms around me.

mels/01135.pt|durations/01135.pt|pitch_char/01135.pt|Please specify your disorder
mels/05903.pt|durations/05903.pt|pitch_char/05903.pt|I'll tell you presently. Soon the girls would begin their tennis parties again.
mels/00165.pt|durations/00165.pt|pitch_char/00165.pt|Please describe your symptoms and or or complications
mels/06678.pt|durations/06678.pt|pitch_char/06678.pt|Somehow, I fancied I felt some one near.
mels/00428.pt|durations/00428.pt|pitch_char/00428.pt|But you'll live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die. That was really good!
mels/00941.pt|durations/00941.pt|pitch_char/00941.pt|You left your hair at my place. I thought you'd need it for your meeting.
mels/04818.pt|durations/04818.pt|pitch_char/04818.pt|I want your opinion. "Good," he said to himself, "those unhappy girls dropped it."
mels/00921.pt|durations/00921.pt|pitch_char/00921.pt|She's this high powered, driven, career type. Identical? People say we look alike.
mels/05006.pt|durations/05006.pt|pitch_char/05006.pt|Some of the strongest characteristics of my life were awakened in my childhood.
mels/01781.pt|durations/01781.pt|pitch_char/01781.pt|Alan. He was unbelievable! It was like he made us into a team.
mels/03692.pt|durations/03692.pt|pitch_char/03692.pt|And your mother, too, is the mother of all?
mels/03048.pt|durations/03048.pt|pitch_char/03048.pt|I can't believe I forgot a magazine. Come on, this might be good. I don't know.
mels/04586.pt|durations/04586.pt|pitch_char/04586.pt|Tell me; can you? But the link between was missing.
mels/04096.pt|durations/04096.pt|pitch_char/04096.pt|Daughters, Willoughby, daughters! You see, we are at the village now.
mels/02778.pt|durations/02778.pt|pitch_char/02778.pt|You don't understand. Yeah right!
mels/02015.pt|durations/02015.pt|pitch_char/02015.pt|Please select your hazardous duties
mels/02458.pt|durations/02458.pt|pitch_char/02458.pt|What are or were your symptoms?
mels/01240.pt|durations/01240.pt|pitch_char/01240.pt|No, I'm fine. See ya. I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was,
mels/05031.pt|durations/05031.pt|pitch_char/05031.pt|Needless to say her critic is a woman.
mels/04296.pt|durations/04296.pt|pitch_char/04296.pt|What does Mrs. Rook matter?
mels/00742.pt|durations/00742.pt|pitch_char/00742.pt|Oh my! Thanks.
mels/06193.pt|durations/06193.pt|pitch_char/06193.pt|I have sworn that you shall live a virtuous life; expect, therefore, many troubles.
mels/02342.pt|durations/02342.pt|pitch_char/02342.pt|Please specify your complaints
mels/03579.pt|durations/03579.pt|pitch_char/03579.pt|Not understand me! And your cheeks are red with blushes!
mels/05558.pt|durations/05558.pt|pitch_char/05558.pt|But this is not enough.
mels/02303.pt|durations/02303.pt|pitch_char/02303.pt|So this time I won't quit.
mels/02098.pt|durations/02098.pt|pitch_char/02098.pt|Do you still have sequelae caused by the poisoning?
mels/01333.pt|durations/01333.pt|pitch_char/01333.pt|Oh, God! I'll be right there, Bernice. Look please don't go anywhere.
mels/04475.pt|durations/04475.pt|pitch_char/04475.pt|More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
mels/05590.pt|durations/05590.pt|pitch_char/05590.pt|They were probably sold at auction and he bought them.
mels/03168.pt|durations/03168.pt|pitch_char/03168.pt|You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it.
mels/05412.pt|durations/05412.pt|pitch_char/05412.pt|She ran her fingers through her loosened hair for a while.
mels/05793.pt|durations/05793.pt|pitch_char/05793.pt|Let me notice one by way of illustration.
mels/05341.pt|durations/05341.pt|pitch_char/05341.pt|The sounds were heard in the other shops, and men came running out.
mels/01794.pt|durations/01794.pt|pitch_char/01794.pt|about making things right? Things were fine the way they were!
mels/00169.pt|durations/00169.pt|pitch_char/00169.pt|we've done some excellent work here. And I would have to say
mels/04280.pt|durations/04280.pt|pitch_char/04280.pt|White Man, step to starboard.
mels/05324.pt|durations/05324.pt|pitch_char/05324.pt|They saw fit to leave their home and their delicate mother.
mels/04868.pt|durations/04868.pt|pitch_char/04868.pt|This woman would not yield to gentler measures; harder must have their turn.
mels/05927.pt|durations/05927.pt|pitch_char/05927.pt|And I also BEHELD twelve others following him.
mels/01829.pt|durations/01829.pt|pitch_char/01829.pt|I don't know. You don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're crazy!
mels/03493.pt|durations/03493.pt|pitch_char/03493.pt|In his opinion the Tsar should be omnipotent.
mels/03371.pt|durations/03371.pt|pitch_char/03371.pt|Hardest work in the world to get him away.
mels/04355.pt|durations/04355.pt|pitch_char/04355.pt|Be gone; we shall be robbed by and by.
mels/02712.pt|durations/02712.pt|pitch_char/02712.pt|Well, we rarely have to return from a fire as quickly.
mels/02636.pt|durations/02636.pt|pitch_char/02636.pt|When did you start having symptoms with your skin?
mels/03204.pt|durations/03204.pt|pitch_char/03204.pt|You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
mels/05602.pt|durations/05602.pt|pitch_char/05602.pt|They all noticed another change in this variable young person.
mels/04656.pt|durations/04656.pt|pitch_char/04656.pt|"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you not come at once?"
mels/05767.pt|durations/05767.pt|pitch_char/05767.pt|I am confident that they cannot deny this.
mels/04205.pt|durations/04205.pt|pitch_char/04205.pt|The reconciled Assembly will not advise; will not interfere.
mels/05814.pt|durations/05814.pt|pitch_char/05814.pt|Presently their path was again intersected with other little tortuous paths.
mels/01753.pt|durations/01753.pt|pitch_char/01753.pt|Here we go. Come on. I'm sorry! Oh, my God! That's it!
mels/06212.pt|durations/06212.pt|pitch_char/06212.pt|And Fred was certainly very fond of his mother.
mels/06068.pt|durations/06068.pt|pitch_char/06068.pt|Well, then, keep up a good heart, mother.
mels/00872.pt|durations/00872.pt|pitch_char/00872.pt|What is the nature of your martial arts activity?
mels/01444.pt|durations/01444.pt|pitch_char/01444.pt|Are you okay? It's just my lens. It's my lens.
mels/04544.pt|durations/04544.pt|pitch_char/04544.pt|At Florence!
mels/02954.pt|durations/02954.pt|pitch_char/02954.pt|A whole other machine for your colors.
mels/00266.pt|durations/00266.pt|pitch_char/00266.pt|Really? We played, watched TV. That juggling thing is amazing.
mels/01372.pt|durations/01372.pt|pitch_char/01372.pt|I hate that guy! What? So he was a little analytical. That's what he does.
mels/04539.pt|durations/04539.pt|pitch_char/04539.pt|It was as much as I could do to assent.
mels/05842.pt|durations/05842.pt|pitch_char/05842.pt|This became my wonder now, while she slowly drew on the second glove.
mels/04760.pt|durations/04760.pt|pitch_char/04760.pt|Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.
mels/06077.pt|durations/06077.pt|pitch_char/06077.pt|Already he thrilled with a sense of POWER and prosperity.
mels/01939.pt|durations/01939.pt|pitch_char/01939.pt|How long will you be staying there?
mels/02216.pt|durations/02216.pt|pitch_char/02216.pt|Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing.
mels/02508.pt|durations/02508.pt|pitch_char/02508.pt|I'm out of here.
mels/00592.pt|durations/00592.pt|pitch_char/00592.pt|The way he makes me feel about myself. Yeah
mels/04222.pt|durations/04222.pt|pitch_char/04222.pt|The thousands of women that were weeping through his fault!
mels/03080.pt|durations/03080.pt|pitch_char/03080.pt|Date night! Saturday night. Saturday night!
mels/02521.pt|durations/02521.pt|pitch_char/02521.pt|I know. One day he's this little thing
mels/06200.pt|durations/06200.pt|pitch_char/06200.pt|The body shuddered. I have not lost a moment, however.
mels/06422.pt|durations/06422.pt|pitch_char/06422.pt|She has been so nice!
mels/01549.pt|durations/01549.pt|pitch_char/01549.pt|Look what I got going. Save it for the cab.
mels/01934.pt|durations/01934.pt|pitch_char/01934.pt|It's gonna be an open casket, you know?
mels/06689.pt|durations/06689.pt|pitch_char/06689.pt|I hope we shall have no more such close calls.
mels/02565.pt|durations/02565.pt|pitch_char/02565.pt|But he's just phoning it in.
mels/02411.pt|durations/02411.pt|pitch_char/02411.pt|Fine. Now you'll never know. We're kidding. Tell us.
mels/01014.pt|durations/01014.pt|pitch_char/01014.pt|How much time do you spend on the following activities
mels/00768.pt|durations/00768.pt|pitch_char/00768.pt|We should really be sitting for this. Sure we should.
mels/03890.pt|durations/03890.pt|pitch_char/03890.pt|Clara has been dreaming about you; and Clara is foolish enough to believe in dreams.
mels/03892.pt|durations/03892.pt|pitch_char/03892.pt|And you see! Do REFLECT that Celeste will probably have five hundred thousand francs.
mels/03682.pt|durations/03682.pt|pitch_char/03682.pt|Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.
mels/01436.pt|durations/01436.pt|pitch_char/01436.pt|I had a dream that I was playing football with my kid.
mels/01357.pt|durations/01357.pt|pitch_char/01357.pt|Your grandmother would've hated this.
mels/00280.pt|durations/00280.pt|pitch_char/00280.pt|That's ridiculous.
mels/02199.pt|durations/02199.pt|pitch_char/02199.pt|Are there any limitations included?
mels/01652.pt|durations/01652.pt|pitch_char/01652.pt|What's wrong? Come on. It's nothing. I'm fine.
mels/02047.pt|durations/02047.pt|pitch_char/02047.pt|that I'm going out with more people than she is.
mels/00724.pt|durations/00724.pt|pitch_char/00724.pt|I better pass on the game.
mels/05173.pt|durations/05173.pt|pitch_char/05173.pt|Also Bella.
mels/05662.pt|durations/05662.pt|pitch_char/05662.pt|Auntie has thought of sending you your hat and coat.
mels/02765.pt|durations/02765.pt|pitch_char/02765.pt|Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping. Say I bought a great pair of shoes.
mels/02266.pt|durations/02266.pt|pitch_char/02266.pt|and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed.
mels/02843.pt|durations/02843.pt|pitch_char/02843.pt|Don't you realise what you're you're doing to yourself?
mels/02593.pt|durations/02593.pt|pitch_char/02593.pt|What were you thinking?
mels/04960.pt|durations/04960.pt|pitch_char/04960.pt|As for entirely hiding that I had used my eyes, I can't say: they must answer for it.
mels/02700.pt|durations/02700.pt|pitch_char/02700.pt|During that second time, you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup! You did it twice?
mels/03841.pt|durations/03841.pt|pitch_char/03841.pt|I saw you come out and sit down here.
mels/01660.pt|durations/01660.pt|pitch_char/01660.pt|And cut! What was that? I was going for quiet desperation.
mels/04307.pt|durations/04307.pt|pitch_char/04307.pt|Philippe talked about things in general, with perfect propriety.
mels/04279.pt|durations/04279.pt|pitch_char/04279.pt|You've got time to lie down about ten minutes.
mels/01492.pt|durations/01492.pt|pitch_char/01492.pt|Why is this girl going to call me?
mels/02597.pt|durations/02597.pt|pitch_char/02597.pt|I know you did, cookie. I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
mels/01904.pt|durations/01904.pt|pitch_char/01904.pt|How long do the symptoms last?
mels/03613.pt|durations/03613.pt|pitch_char/03613.pt|She was a kindly woman, and she had ached with pity.
mels/02169.pt|durations/02169.pt|pitch_char/02169.pt|I'm not at all surprised about that. That's why you're so great. Which has nothing to do with it. I found out today.
mels/05625.pt|durations/05625.pt|pitch_char/05625.pt|I suppose he has not gone away with anyone?
mels/05351.pt|durations/05351.pt|pitch_char/05351.pt|For I certainly know that face, that look, that expression.
mels/06580.pt|durations/06580.pt|pitch_char/06580.pt|Experience teaches more than inspiration. "This is my favorite walk," she said, simply, "since I have been in Edinburgh." Be yourself, and think of nothing but me.
mels/00194.pt|durations/00194.pt|pitch_char/00194.pt|So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
mels/04056.pt|durations/04056.pt|pitch_char/04056.pt|And now you'd better go. I long to see.
mels/00766.pt|durations/00766.pt|pitch_char/00766.pt|You gotta do it man.
mels/02246.pt|durations/02246.pt|pitch_char/02246.pt|Not so much.
mels/01907.pt|durations/01907.pt|pitch_char/01907.pt|Now wait a second.
mels/05557.pt|durations/05557.pt|pitch_char/05557.pt|Under suspicion?
mels/02870.pt|durations/02870.pt|pitch_char/02870.pt|We just feel that he's.
mels/04836.pt|durations/04836.pt|pitch_char/04836.pt|The inevitable inquiries and explanations followed. This, however, looked like preparation.
mels/01065.pt|durations/01065.pt|pitch_char/01065.pt|But it's not gonna work. If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
mels/01995.pt|durations/01995.pt|pitch_char/01995.pt|Sorry
mels/03356.pt|durations/03356.pt|pitch_char/03356.pt|Amanda Gill had reached it.
mels/05169.pt|durations/05169.pt|pitch_char/05169.pt|We only reached our moorings two hours since.
mels/04753.pt|durations/04753.pt|pitch_char/04753.pt|I also undertook to procure. Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the way home again.
mels/03224.pt|durations/03224.pt|pitch_char/03224.pt|What are you talking about? Don't feel bad.
mels/03097.pt|durations/03097.pt|pitch_char/03097.pt|When have you been diagnosed the first time for this condition?
mels/06818.pt|durations/06818.pt|pitch_char/06818.pt|We were flat. I suppose I do. He had the drop on him.
mels/05547.pt|durations/05547.pt|pitch_char/05547.pt|This hint had a magical effect on the ushers and the young lawyer.
mels/02819.pt|durations/02819.pt|pitch_char/02819.pt|We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.
mels/05062.pt|durations/05062.pt|pitch_char/05062.pt|It is the same thing, my dear monsieur.
mels/02448.pt|durations/02448.pt|pitch_char/02448.pt|No problem. I'm not done yet. Why would someone do that?
mels/05654.pt|durations/05654.pt|pitch_char/05654.pt|You aren't afraid to ride in THAT, are you?
mels/03349.pt|durations/03349.pt|pitch_char/03349.pt|There is a comfortable sofa. What difference would it make?
mels/05755.pt|durations/05755.pt|pitch_char/05755.pt|She was that sort. THEN there ensued a subdued wrangle in the yard.
mels/05481.pt|durations/05481.pt|pitch_char/05481.pt|He drained his glass. I will give you some friendly advice.
mels/01535.pt|durations/01535.pt|pitch_char/01535.pt|there's something you should know.
mels/04244.pt|durations/04244.pt|pitch_char/04244.pt|The big sorrel could not be gotten into Surprise Valley.
mels/00989.pt|durations/00989.pt|pitch_char/00989.pt|No that was clenching.
mels/00526.pt|durations/00526.pt|pitch_char/00526.pt|It was comfortable and it was familiar.
mels/02299.pt|durations/02299.pt|pitch_char/02299.pt|I'm really not.
mels/05394.pt|durations/05394.pt|pitch_char/05394.pt|There were more than a hundred pieces, and every one of them gold.
mels/02179.pt|durations/02179.pt|pitch_char/02179.pt|Everybody, this is Danielle. Danielle, everybody. Why are you here?
mels/00932.pt|durations/00932.pt|pitch_char/00932.pt|You finally get up the courage to do it. There's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
mels/03609.pt|durations/03609.pt|pitch_char/03609.pt|Nay, speak no more now. These damned civilians!
mels/06154.pt|durations/06154.pt|pitch_char/06154.pt|Blaine.
mels/05254.pt|durations/05254.pt|pitch_char/05254.pt|And smashed the conventions of Society whenever you saw fit.
mels/02478.pt|durations/02478.pt|pitch_char/02478.pt|David's, like, a scientist guy. He's very methodical.
mels/03884.pt|durations/03884.pt|pitch_char/03884.pt|Ay, for the partridge, mother! Bless your honor!
mels/04389.pt|durations/04389.pt|pitch_char/04389.pt|Was it respect? The answer would cover all the grades.
mels/02052.pt|durations/02052.pt|pitch_char/02052.pt|I'll go see. This almost never happens.
mels/01199.pt|durations/01199.pt|pitch_char/01199.pt|Yeah, I know. I'm just not that bright either.
mels/00037.pt|durations/00037.pt|pitch_char/00037.pt|When were your last symptoms of this disorder?
mels/04647.pt|durations/04647.pt|pitch_char/04647.pt|The great thing is that the discovery is made.
mels/01966.pt|durations/01966.pt|pitch_char/01966.pt|What does Bob look like? Is he tall, short? Yep.
mels/06134.pt|durations/06134.pt|pitch_char/06134.pt|I have no prospects of money from my own family. So I is! The Spirit and the Bride say: Come!
mels/02920.pt|durations/02920.pt|pitch_char/02920.pt|What is the difference in leg length?
mels/06255.pt|durations/06255.pt|pitch_char/06255.pt|Those poor creatures! And that one can well understand.
mels/02368.pt|durations/02368.pt|pitch_char/02368.pt|Do you see anybody you think could be me?
mels/06159.pt|durations/06159.pt|pitch_char/06159.pt|The man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings.
mels/04878.pt|durations/04878.pt|pitch_char/04878.pt|He drew his hand back as though to throw the volume at them.
mels/02419.pt|durations/02419.pt|pitch_char/02419.pt|Please state your unearned income of the last three years, property rental income, dividend from shares, interests or other
mels/05669.pt|durations/05669.pt|pitch_char/05669.pt|At the door he turned.
mels/04303.pt|durations/04303.pt|pitch_char/04303.pt|With that they will sleep warmly; not so bad.
mels/02040.pt|durations/02040.pt|pitch_char/02040.pt|Okay, windows are clean. Candles are lit. Am I out of control?

mels/06294.pt|durations/06294.pt|pitch_char/06294.pt|See how she loved her husband. We must somehow have mistaken our bearings.
