wavs/03925.wav|You may let your fancy run wild. Divorce!
wavs/04053.wav|Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
wavs/02807.wav|I got her machine. Her answering machine?
wavs/02091.wav|e was like that that that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions,
wavs/00205.wav|Do you have ongoing complaints?
wavs/04717.wav|They seem to me to treat one quite differently.
wavs/06036.wav|This poor girl does not seem to understand even the rudiments of concealment.
wavs/01710.wav|I don't know if it's me or his hunger strike, I don't know.
wavs/05149.wav|If the Platonic stage lasts a little too long, the affair grows ruinous.
wavs/01585.wav|This isn't about you.
wavs/01891.wav|Been admitted overnight to a hospital or referred to a psychiatrist for mental illness, anorexia or bulimia?
wavs/03975.wav|He's getting us to turn on one another.
wavs/01271.wav|Did I say that out loud? Oh really?
wavs/01613.wav|I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you. I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
wavs/00065.wav|Which part of body was affected
wavs/04672.wav|Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
wavs/02853.wav|I don't know. Why? Why would I? Why?
wavs/04727.wav|And WHERE is the furnace itself? Is not our Kate afflicted?
wavs/04046.wav|"But after all," I said, "the cause MATTERS very little." He came to me, and I came down here to tell her it was all right.
wavs/01349.wav|When did the therapy stop?
wavs/06555.wav|He chooses to pay his court to me.
wavs/04689.wav|Ned Newton's. These fruits enclosed no kernel. And what is THAT gentleman's business?
wavs/02800.wav|Do you race for pleasure only?
wavs/05802.wav|I've always thought I'd like to see the state where my sister lived.
wavs/02431.wav|You don't know? She seems nice, but that thing about her coming all the way here
wavs/00050.wav|She said yes! I like that better.
wavs/01330.wav|In some ways, I think he is so right for me.
wavs/03832.wav|The princess CLOSED her eyes.
wavs/01562.wav|When was you last symptom?
wavs/03460.wav|How far from hence? To go and become a Republican!
wavs/06387.wav|But the boat had soon carried them on and left the place behind.
wavs/02848.wav|Well, because you just I don't like this question. See, you guys? What if we don't get magic beans?
wavs/06194.wav|Let us suppose, for example, that the wedding takes place at high noon in exclusive old "Trinity" church, New York.
wavs/03104.wav|Second date! I don't know.
wavs/00473.wav|The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
wavs/03326.wav|I thought that movie was so incredibly boring. That thing at the end where the kid
wavs/05816.wav|Yes, and some one else.
wavs/02491.wav|Will you give me the thing? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
wavs/06618.wav|Madam would speak with me.
wavs/02005.wav|Listen
wavs/04875.wav|Seeking a FIGHT with me!
wavs/03219.wav|Do you think that was wrong? I think he's across the hall.
wavs/03640.wav|I want him to know.
wavs/01867.wav|No. Forget it.
wavs/02410.wav|Was there
wavs/03402.wav|But if it be not gone, then there may yet be another token.
wavs/04679.wav|He stood adamant in the doorway of the cab.
wavs/01852.wav|I haven't used my card in weeks. That is the unusual activity.
wavs/00647.wav|Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?
wavs/03643.wav|I always suspected that I was served by a woman.
wavs/00562.wav|my.
wavs/04953.wav|The loss of her jewel seems almost to have turned her brain. Happy.
wavs/04379.wav|Some of the general PUBLIC were present, then?
wavs/03431.wav|It seemed to be a TRIFLE incongruous now.
wavs/01018.wav|to stop calling, stop sending flowers and to leave you alone?
wavs/04885.wav|She looks awful bad to me. Would we swing back over the Divide?
wavs/00754.wav|I'm getting good at this. Excellent!
wavs/06400.wav|Yes; he has come sooner than I expected.
wavs/05032.wav|Friendships may be too violent; and they may be too sensitive.
wavs/04615.wav|Not greatly. In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
wavs/06222.wav|We could hardly stand against the wind. I give it up to you.
wavs/01526.wav|What's going on? Hello Joey!
wavs/02432.wav|Can we change the subject please?
wavs/05775.wav|I seldom say so much about myself as I have said to you.
wavs/05690.wav|Indeed I will, if you would like to see me.
wavs/04709.wav|Her brother had taken the greater portion and had gone into a far country.
wavs/03336.wav|Attached to the expedition? That ere you came into Albania.
wavs/02846.wav|So I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Bye.
wavs/05048.wav|I'll get the old lady to mind the shop.
wavs/03604.wav|The angel of immortal life rises from the altar of sacrifice.
wavs/02764.wav|But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
wavs/05142.wav|Let him wait until you please to see him.
wavs/06220.wav|It vanished also. Mr. Miles lowered his voice.
wavs/03010.wav|Say your son never feels connected to you as one.
wavs/02284.wav|Well I mean
wavs/02678.wav|If you were older or I was younger
wavs/00204.wav|Thank you. That wasn't a real date.
wavs/02640.wav|Which other type of diving do you do?
wavs/05655.wav|From TIME to time she paused, and tenderly kissed the police agent's coat.
wavs/01687.wav|This was a pact! This was your pact!
wavs/04659.wav|The mystery.
wavs/04017.wav|They said you were dead. Then they must be distinguished?
wavs/04388.wav|Mass, I cannot tell. Do you like it better than living over here?
wavs/04474.wav|The best of weapons is the undaunted heart.
wavs/03869.wav|They ran about calling to one another to receive the Ancients.
wavs/06051.wav|I said: I wonder whether you know what you are doing?
wavs/06172.wav|I thought you were East, keeping Jenks away FROM here.
wavs/06748.wav|Do you know where you will send Lucien? Fatal!
wavs/00513.wav|I don't get how guys can do so many mean things
wavs/03145.wav|They don't Like you.
wavs/04253.wav|Now I'll tell you what I am a going to do for you.
wavs/06359.wav|At length finds rest. After all this fuss?
wavs/05524.wav|He took the opposite corner to that of Oscar, on the same seat.
wavs/00375.wav|I thought she had a hard quality.
wavs/02805.wav|No.
wavs/04502.wav|No, I will not do her any harm, dear little soul!
wavs/02127.wav|Where are they? Where are they? This is nice. We never do anything, just the two of us.
wavs/06147.wav|He was in too much excitement to wait.
wavs/05056.wav|Wherein also the Quack shall, in all ages, come in for his share.
wavs/01455.wav|Occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose.
wavs/01641.wav|No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? What?
wavs/05305.wav|He's got to find out whether I have or not.
wavs/04799.wav|The steward to whom he made his application shook his head with regret.
wavs/02728.wav|It's been seven seconds, and you haven't asked me how my date went.
wavs/00401.wav|Well fall out of it.
wavs/04611.wav|I shall seek you at the earliest occasion. Most excellent.
wavs/04541.wav|I thought you were wonderful.
wavs/06391.wav|His touch struck me cold.
wavs/04288.wav|So soon was the engagement ended that disappointment imposed upon the ranger's warlike ecstasy.
wavs/03159.wav|Where have you been?
wavs/05500.wav|Even the CHILDREN were gone.
wavs/05243.wav|The sun was peeping above the horizon as they crossed the stony field and made for the wood. "Do you mean to say," gasped Priscilla, "that I can return to earth?"
wavs/05453.wav|Many in the audience closed their eyes to meditate.
wavs/03101.wav|So I balled it up and now I wish I was dead. I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition.
wavs/03043.wav|What is you occupational status?
wavs/05387.wav|I suppose it is a commonplace in yours.
wavs/04903.wav|The fact is, James was standing on one leg.
wavs/01803.wav|Yes? Yes she is.
wavs/03790.wav|Armand says you are brave.
wavs/01404.wav|did you have a cyst, growth or tumour in either your brain or spine?
wavs/00935.wav|How'd it go?
wavs/00498.wav|Where does this disorder exist?
wavs/05862.wav|The Magic Wand. Oh, I wonder if it's true?
wavs/03533.wav|These have passed over it, or may have passed!
wavs/05163.wav|How the devil did you know that Miss Lockwood was coming to Venice?
wavs/06471.wav|It is all good, though variously good; yet the wise world asks for the masterpiece.
wavs/04747.wav|Cut it!
wavs/00529.wav|Now, come on. Get out of my way.
wavs/00707.wav|it is nothing Like that. Listen listen.
wavs/04068.wav|I know the landlord this many a year.
wavs/04533.wav|We call the short hand the hour hand, for it tells the hours.
wavs/05413.wav|They were laughing. And what do you intend to do?
wavs/01695.wav|Do you participate in competitions?
wavs/00116.wav|Okay what kind of ritual? Or?
wavs/04050.wav|Unhappy!
wavs/03359.wav|Have you told her? But rest was not for him.
wavs/00813.wav|Yes I am sure.
wavs/05684.wav|Then WHAT does he want with us? Yes; with me. You took your chances.
wavs/06046.wav|You have read him? O Giles, this day you've sworn away my life!
wavs/03955.wav|I think I will stay with him tonight.
wavs/06030.wav|The witness describes us the event in definite tones which are echoed to us.
wavs/06687.wav|Whether we come or go, or whence or where.
wavs/03439.wav|Difficulties in discussing the slavery question. Thus far they were at ONE; but no farther.
wavs/04009.wav|Did I come on this voyage in order to catch rheumatism and pneumonia?
wavs/03976.wav|Bless my bookcase! Is it possible you are Barnum?
wavs/06019.wav|Why is.
wavs/02879.wav|What would you do if you were omnipotent?
wavs/05021.wav|As for the ornaments of the room, they were entirely beyond my appreciation.
wavs/02114.wav|She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back!
wavs/03399.wav|I should think you could be glad of that.
wavs/05898.wav|Can he catch it? Work that she could do.
wavs/03935.wav|Holy Angels!
wavs/00672.wav|Come on! Do it do it!
wavs/01260.wav|anybody else there?
wavs/04221.wav|I shall be glad if you would accompany me there by the next train.
wavs/05363.wav|But it involves a happiness that will last throughout our lives, will it not?
wavs/05916.wav|There nothing is real. He noticed two unusual things on entering the room.
wavs/04111.wav|I wondered less when the woman finally ushered me upstairs to my rooms.
wavs/00583.wav|Say you never feel like a father.
wavs/04526.wav|He sat down and crossed his arms fiercely.
wavs/04808.wav|I felt the responsibility of my new relation and tried hard to do right.
wavs/05009.wav|Shall we exclude the opposite process? Heavy matters, heavy matters!
wavs/04089.wav|It leaves me with my energies worn out, with my sensibilities frightfully acute.
wavs/06007.wav|I have read the tale.
wavs/05019.wav|I coughed and spat blood all the night.
wavs/00080.wav|When somebody steals
wavs/04830.wav|Diamonds.
wavs/06733.wav|When I got to the corner I had to catch the post for support.
wavs/02174.wav|If you don't mind, I'd like a moment alone.
wavs/03396.wav|Would you? Before you had worn it out.
wavs/02045.wav|Magic is about to happen!
wavs/02234.wav|Well maybe I am a little.
wavs/06780.wav|The man, having a brief authority, parted with him.
wavs/02028.wav|wasn't even her major!
wavs/02451.wav|No no. That would be me again. I'm just trying something.
wavs/06612.wav|Good if so far we live in them when gone!
wavs/04429.wav|We'll talk about something else now, I think.
wavs/00055.wav|What occupation has been advised to you?
wavs/02268.wav|Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys. That's a good one! Hey.
wavs/05077.wav|She looked at me wildly, with a cry of terror.
wavs/04970.wav|Hi, friend!
wavs/03093.wav|I'm working tomorrow
wavs/02059.wav|What a neat idea! All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
wavs/02507.wav|I'm not.
wavs/05197.wav|She was the right sort of woman, your mother!
wavs/02313.wav|I'm doing new material tonight.
wavs/04983.wav|He was strongly and painfully impressed by what he had heard.
wavs/05757.wav|Once more I made the experiment: she snapped at me like a dog, and bit me.
wavs/02831.wav|I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down. No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
wavs/05011.wav|But the Whigs were a small and a disheartened minority.
wavs/05759.wav|Brother and sister were bound together by an extreme affection.
wavs/01026.wav|The second guy. I see.
wavs/02274.wav|Thank you.
wavs/04106.wav|And who thinks the worse of him for it?
wavs/05815.wav|Mr. Dale gulped a ball in his throat.
wavs/00918.wav|Twice.
wavs/02468.wav|Have you suffered from any consequences or complications?
wavs/04788.wav|So there you are. Other men and boys saw the point and followed.
wavs/05315.wav|It was a marvellous guess. But it was a reflection only.
wavs/01254.wav|Is that what this is about? No no. I was just wondering.
wavs/03015.wav|How many flights did you have in the last two months?
wavs/02772.wav|I guess this belongs to you. Or maybe some day Mindy. Like she'd settle for that.
wavs/04278.wav|But Calvin wished to destroy caste AMONG the clergy, and consequently spiritual tyranny.
wavs/00025.wav|This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
wavs/05283.wav|Forgive me then! That would be very SIMPLE, and it would be economical.
wavs/05656.wav|Seen her? One of the old fashioned kind.
wavs/06594.wav|What ails her at all? More reluctantly the boy obeyed.
wavs/04510.wav|What are you going to send to the Salon?
wavs/05485.wav|And now she's sweet on him after he's dead.
wavs/00181.wav|Most women would kill
wavs/05809.wav|They smiled among themselves, but made no answer.
wavs/02330.wav|All right once
wavs/04862.wav|Her letters?
wavs/06669.wav|What does your question mean? The suggestion I offered amounted briefly to this.
wavs/06274.wav|No, sir, you won't! He was tried, convicted, and sentenced.
wavs/06583.wav|Perhaps we shall meet again. Might not this turn the scale AGAINST them?
wavs/00700.wav|Do you still have symptoms or complaints due to the disorder?
wavs/04858.wav|She preferred to receive CATHERINE and her daughter at home.
wavs/00632.wav|Do you still have symptoms and complications?
wavs/04932.wav|It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
wavs/00112.wav|And then he woke up and there was this big plant
wavs/03530.wav|What letter?
wavs/05713.wav|Between seven and eight next morning, he presented HIMSELF again at the office.
wavs/02023.wav|We got the proofs from the shoot with the vegetables. I blew off the afternoon. I went shopping.
wavs/05321.wav|Nothing in this universe seemed quite natural to Michael Moon.
wavs/04728.wav|Will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?
wavs/03599.wav|And what shall I do to earn your bounty, lady?
wavs/00170.wav|When did hospitalisation and or or rehabilitation take place?
wavs/05398.wav|I have heard him even spoken of as a philanthropist.
wavs/01396.wav|That's all right, dear. Here you go.
wavs/02092.wav|When did you receive official authorization for working with explosives?
wavs/06646.wav|I only came in the day before yesterday.
wavs/00098.wav|How often have you undergone surgery?
wavs/04095.wav|In the silence of the night her voice was UNUSUALLY clear and distinct.
wavs/03552.wav|Upon it was painted a wonderful picture. Second, increased development of scientific studies.
wavs/02362.wav|That's all you wanted to ask? That's all. What? That's not all.
wavs/03368.wav|There are forty chickens here. But the result justified him.
wavs/06204.wav|During the six working days no creature was slain.
wavs/04573.wav|He seems to dread taking the slightest advantage.
wavs/05718.wav|Oh hark!
wavs/05167.wav|Winter passed.
wavs/00163.wav|Yeah. Could I take her?
wavs/00234.wav|Please state the condition of the person with such disease
wavs/00273.wav|who thinks things are other things. When the phone rings and she takes a shower.
wavs/05117.wav|She did not mean it. What kind of bird may it be, pray?
wavs/02886.wav|Well I I could live without it. Oh, you do, do you?
wavs/04461.wav|I'll take it with me.
wavs/06435.wav|He folded his hands, trembling. She looked at me as she took them.
wavs/02054.wav|I can't believe you moved the green ottoman.
wavs/03092.wav|For how long have you been unable to work?
wavs/01380.wav|What treatment do you take for your diabetes?
wavs/02102.wav|Ring, damn it, ring. Thanks. You know our phone's not working? What?
wavs/03072.wav|What's wrong? Why so scrunchie?
wavs/02258.wav|Please describe you martial arts activities
wavs/03911.wav|He thought even as things were they could certainly fight for a year.
wavs/05808.wav|Personally I was a little hazy and uncertain.
wavs/01544.wav|She's too much for me in bed.
wavs/03706.wav|What had I been saying to displease you? I only half comprehend her.
wavs/00091.wav|I see you moved the green ottoman. How did that happen?
wavs/06477.wav|When he made it! You did; but you don't now.
wavs/06659.wav|But I don't mind his beginning by liking me.
wavs/03321.wav|If you want, I'll break it off with her. No, don't do that. Not for me.
wavs/02075.wav|Yes! Did you see that? You were incredible.
wavs/04594.wav|Let me do her justice, if I can.
wavs/00154.wav|Focus? There's nothing to focus on.
wavs/01463.wav|I'm gonna ask once, and I want a straight answer.
wavs/04661.wav|A phenomenon to which "well drilled" policemen are no strangers. Inspector Jacks shrugged his shoulders. Perhaps it was not altogether his fault.
wavs/02820.wav|Your sister stood me up the other night. You got a minute?
wavs/04323.wav|Now you come, Mary Judson!
wavs/03360.wav|Gaston stopped. O hugely shameless! The time passed slowly.
wavs/02353.wav|Look I gotta tell you something. I have a wife. I have a job. I'm your congressman.
wavs/00143.wav|See how he was sweating when he walked out?
wavs/02548.wav|Or I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring. You've got Carol tomorrow.
wavs/03733.wav|And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
wavs/05616.wav|I will put earth in the coffin, reverend Mother.
wavs/04690.wav|After her, after her. I'm afraid we can do nothing against such a number.
wavs/00019.wav|At least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.
wavs/05892.wav|Look at the timber on it. And you had no reason.
wavs/03197.wav|Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn!
wavs/00871.wav|Shut up Joey!
wavs/04404.wav|Here he was able, but there played the Fire.
wavs/04677.wav|He was handsome; so correctly handsome, that a slight unfriendly touch precipitated him into caricature.
wavs/06174.wav|His face frightened her, and she lied vehemently.
wavs/01309.wav|Yeah. If we put our heads together, between the two of us
wavs/02775.wav|Is it something you'd like to share with the group?
wavs/02850.wav|What is or was the method of treatment?
wavs/02549.wav|Are there further loans?
wavs/03476.wav|She was mistaken in part.
wavs/00880.wav|Whatever you want.
wavs/00718.wav|Actually, it's quite typical behavior
wavs/01098.wav|Come on, we're great together. Why not?
wavs/04506.wav|Yet for genuine excitement and thrill, give me the small boat.
wavs/02163.wav|No, I'm fine. Thanks. See you.
wavs/05174.wav|Then Tom May brought their thoughts back to the reason of the visit.
wavs/03401.wav|Yet of one THING we may be glad.
wavs/06517.wav|A prisoner took my measure for a suit of clothes.
wavs/04503.wav|Yes, madam; but my lady did not see that part.
wavs/02209.wav|Can I use either thumb? All right. Don't tell me.
wavs/06552.wav|No indeed I am not.
wavs/01020.wav|Did this disorder occur several times?
wavs/06263.wav|What I heard was the groan of a dying animal.
wavs/03421.wav|They keep chopping and changing their bits of land.
wavs/06224.wav|There was a troubled expression in her eyes.
wavs/03301.wav|That's what you've been working on for two hours? Go away. Stop looking in here.
wavs/00898.wav|What's going on? Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
wavs/05134.wav|I have been seeing THEIR intimacy with the greatest pleasure.
wavs/06233.wav|Shall prove to monsters, spoiling of their joys.
wavs/01767.wav|It was unbelievable! I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life!
wavs/02909.wav|Are the radioactive substances
wavs/05839.wav|This taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods.
wavs/01427.wav|Have you ever claimed for disability benefits?
wavs/02071.wav|When was your last attack?
wavs/01624.wav|You know what? What? There were times
wavs/06456.wav|But what are these compared with the sacred relics? Her very eyes were hungry.
wavs/03481.wav|I have seen a weakness in me that would have carried me anywhere.
wavs/05183.wav|You, my darling, have brought about this change in my life. All hail!
wavs/01319.wav|God he's good. Oh Lamb Chop!
wavs/00338.wav|You okay?
wavs/03626.wav|It was in this part that the tables for the suitors were laid.
wavs/02403.wav|You're one to talk.
wavs/01531.wav|hey that's me!
wavs/06093.wav|But what in the world can I do?
wavs/03993.wav|I am glad you acted fairly by her.
wavs/02970.wav|See you.
wavs/01899.wav|Do you still suffer from the disorder?
wavs/03443.wav|He had suffered the family destiny without having shaped it.
wavs/00047.wav|A thumb? I know. I opened it and there it was
wavs/03912.wav|Then I let it fall again, and lo!
wavs/02142.wav|What was the other cause?
wavs/04779.wav|This logic stopped all argument. Oh serious square! Berlin, tom.
wavs/04518.wav|Intellect is, as some one has said, a sort of disease: it is incurable.
wavs/01784.wav|And I am late for keeping up with it, okay?
wavs/05671.wav|I thought the old wound had healed by this time.
wavs/06516.wav|My mother always left her small children in the care of the servants.
wavs/03678.wav|Have patience; all may yet go well. The Romans had assumed that charge.
wavs/02467.wav|Are you under regular medical supervision by a physician?
wavs/04976.wav|She smiled faintly while she fondled its silky, flapping ears.
wavs/02657.wav|Okay, but don't eat it till you get on the plane. Okay bye
wavs/00100.wav|What is or was your treatment
wavs/00034.wav|who lived in a shoe for a while. 
wavs/04532.wav|And short.
wavs/05640.wav|She seated herself again and regarded the American thoughtfully.
wavs/04609.wav|They all did thus, except Benjamin, who stayed true to Judah.
wavs/00414.wav|Do you all promise?
wavs/00221.wav|I'm a little younger than I said.
wavs/04945.wav|He built monasteries and churches in the conquered territories.
wavs/02278.wav|it kind of looks like an old potato. Then don't do that all right?
wavs/04803.wav|She heard the wash against the jetty, felt the rolling of its waves.
wavs/04215.wav|An island, with the sea Breaking all round it, like a blooming hedge.
wavs/04385.wav|What mischief? Of good troops he had not fifty thousand.
wavs/05428.wav|You cannot hang this Anarchy; it is like to hang you: you must needs treat with it. I could see her just well enough to follow.
wavs/01189.wav|Excuse me? You left out the stupid part.
wavs/03847.wav|Sometimes Eliza MADE illuminating speeches.
wavs/01152.wav|No because you won't let that happen.
wavs/03496.wav|Anna, you hurt me. Are the gentlemen alive?
wavs/02769.wav|I thought that was just a rumor. True story.
wavs/03373.wav|You CANNOT take a child from a mother in this way.
wavs/01706.wav|Ow. Sorry.
wavs/04934.wav|It is but the tomb of mighty Rome.
wavs/06033.wav|And they made a league for the well of oath.
wavs/03979.wav|Softly and swiftly, SIR, for the priest is ready.
wavs/03154.wav|When was your last suicide attempt?
wavs/00859.wav|Yeah. Yeah excellent. Good for me!
wavs/01374.wav|You gotta let them make their own mistakes. And think, in a few years, we'll turn into them.
wavs/03008.wav|Why would a parent name their child Bethel? Is he gonna live with you in your apartment?
wavs/00790.wav|Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
wavs/04670.wav|We've got to get busy!
wavs/02241.wav|it was really nice. You would've liked it. We're starting to see some real progress here.
wavs/06716.wav|A look from me, and they consume and die.
wavs/00730.wav|What a beautiful story. I'm fine, by the way. I'm sorry.
wavs/05075.wav|I want your opinion; I want your advice.
wavs/00321.wav|Are resting in a little yellow jar
wavs/06820.wav|From earliest light, a sleepless Permanent Committee has heard the old cry, now waxing almost frantic, mutinous: Arms!
wavs/00089.wav|Who? Me! Was that not clear?
wavs/02185.wav|Why do they have to become people? Why do they have
wavs/05438.wav|Now I am well again.
wavs/02702.wav|I've heard so much about all you guys. I'll call you tomorrow.
wavs/06089.wav|His cheeks were pale, his teeth WERE chattering.
wavs/06784.wav|The secretary took a pencil and a tablet from his breast pocket. Well, because!
wavs/01666.wav|You can spot someone who's never seen his plays.
wavs/04212.wav|Had he not wits to pierce the mask he wooed? He is tolerant.
wavs/01898.wav|when I'll regret asking the following question, but.
wavs/02837.wav|Big ring!
wavs/03516.wav|At five, supper was ready for the family.
wavs/01488.wav|so nothing. Although, Aruba. This time of year?
wavs/03066.wav|How was the game?
wavs/03572.wav|My memory cannot place him in any remembered scene.
wavs/04431.wav|When I look at them I can see what they want to say.
wavs/05154.wav|Many a night I sobbed myself to sleep.
wavs/01482.wav|I'm really gonna miss you.
wavs/01554.wav|But it isn't me. It's not me. That is why we don't do it!
wavs/03837.wav|And the dispatch which I am carrying to The Hague?
wavs/06649.wav|But whatever he did was wise and enlightened. And tie it on behind.
wavs/06547.wav|Having settled that, I left John in charge.
wavs/00119.wav|What other racing do you do? Please indicate the kind of motor cycle, races, annual frequency, participation in competitions, etc.
wavs/01007.wav|When was the surgery done right eye
wavs/04897.wav|I assert that they have damaged your vital power.
wavs/06207.wav|After THIS we had quite an interesting time.
wavs/01341.wav|That's it? Yeah, it was really hard.
wavs/01356.wav|What other bikes do you use? Please describe your cycling activities
wavs/03895.wav|But where were the Conservatives all this time?
wavs/05451.wav|Venters gasped in the gathering might of the truth.
wavs/03149.wav|And everybody knows this? Yeah. Cushions the blow.
wavs/02505.wav|You're not seeing him anymore? No.
wavs/04673.wav|Get together.
wavs/01895.wav|Can you believe it?
wavs/01548.wav|From the nursery rhyme. There was a crooked man with a crooked smile
wavs/05670.wav|The finest ant's palace, with seven hundred passages!
wavs/00412.wav|I was filling out my friend's form
wavs/03943.wav|What a beautiful day! To come back to my text!
wavs/05980.wav|Is it well to keep these things from the young?
wavs/04386.wav|She welcomed the Prince with a little flush of pleasure.
wavs/00222.wav|Oh that's attractive. I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs.
wavs/05792.wav|Let me see the writing.
wavs/05061.wav|You know the sort. That cannot choose but amaze him. You are suffering?
wavs/04041.wav|The EMPEROR laughed and bowed. He did not comprehend.
wavs/02377.wav|Remember when you were a kid, I'd take you to the navy yard? I wanted you to think of a nice memory so you'd know I'm not a terrible guy.
wavs/01678.wav|Do you currently suffer from any of the following complaints?
wavs/05864.wav|Precisely as it happened, so I tell it you.
wavs/03962.wav|Poor chance!
wavs/04618.wav|My work is for the glory of my family.
wavs/00354.wav|I'd like that!
wavs/03622.wav|Why should I be afraid of losing my life?
wavs/05409.wav|The cat.
wavs/05002.wav|One taken for another; replacing one thing by something else. But of course there was none.
wavs/00720.wav|What is the cause of your allergic reaction? Please precise your allergic reaction by adding substances to your term
wavs/02691.wav|We wanna know. Come on! Are we greeting each other this way now? I like that.
wavs/02486.wav|Have you called her? She'd know I like her. That's crazy.
wavs/02271.wav|What? It's just a phase.
wavs/04943.wav|Now run!
wavs/06135.wav|With the same flash three men sprang at his throat.
wavs/03796.wav|He ran down for a day or two at the club.
wavs/05754.wav|Jean drawled.
wavs/00640.wav|When was this condition diagnosed?
wavs/02854.wav|Do you? Do you? Oh, hey. You must need detergent. Have you never done this before?
wavs/02590.wav|Has your skin disorder been treated by a doctor?
wavs/05245.wav|First, the inner hall, leading to the chief staircase. Won't you have a chair?
wavs/05299.wav|What he had to say to the Sergeant was spoken in my presence.
wavs/06122.wav|Oh that I had that!
wavs/04005.wav|And chuckled.
wavs/05817.wav|It was the only spot of light in the room. Here, old man!
wavs/04888.wav|There are various reports of what Lincoln said.
wavs/05403.wav|He fairly dropped asleep on the ROOF over the funeral march.
wavs/01318.wav|Okay, I'm not getting this. I'm totally getting it. Do you ever feel like you're so uncoordinated?
wavs/04266.wav|Her heart whispered, Risk it! The horrors of the night before had fled.
wavs/04812.wav|I shouldn't think there'd be much fun in it.
wavs/04892.wav|But you have to be back for tea, I suppose?
wavs/05631.wav|I thought she would not last another day.
wavs/04963.wav|If she asks you to do anything, refuse it outright.
wavs/04302.wav|She had not had to put the thought from her mind; it had not been there.
wavs/00420.wav|How many hours per week?
wavs/03178.wav|It might take the heat off of me. They were not playing well.
wavs/05562.wav|In this manner, however, has the Day bent downwards.
wavs/00482.wav|No, don't do that. Not for me.
wavs/06816.wav|Sorry, Rama.
wavs/03057.wav|I'm telling you, you'll be fine. Thank you, Daddy.
wavs/01770.wav|I can't even do laundry!
wavs/00939.wav|Do you participate for pleasure only?
wavs/05595.wav|You EXACT the history of my past life; here it is.
wavs/05357.wav|Sweet leaves, shade folly. Pardon me, and farewell.
wavs/02297.wav|Let me get you some coffee. Thanks. I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy. No, you don't.
wavs/03079.wav|So how'd it go?
wavs/02621.wav|Can't you just picture him in bed? I really don't want to.
wavs/01546.wav|Does your allergy cause gastrointestinal symptoms? Such as abdominal pain, bloating vomiting diarrhoea?
wavs/04363.wav|Then took up his position behind the door.
wavs/01588.wav|What is the maximum depth you dive to?
wavs/01582.wav|You know I just
wavs/02576.wav|I've been talking about myself all night long. I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me a story.
wavs/04648.wav|But this generous stroke of policy cost her heart dear.
wavs/04064.wav|We have seventy bedrooms, and only half a dozen or so of us.
wavs/03838.wav|And as for the country beyond it, that went on, they thought, forever.
wavs/04129.wav|The boats were afraid to close. He addressed himself once more to Horace.
wavs/00132.wav|We can't do that! What? What can't you do?
wavs/06353.wav|Master and valet paid no FURTHER attention to Marguerite.
wavs/05993.wav|He is UNLIKELY to choose me for his confidante.
wavs/05437.wav|But where should he go?
wavs/02027.wav|I know.
wavs/00785.wav|Even when you practice it at home, man, oh, man
wavs/01468.wav|It was. What's the problem? This isn't easy for me either.
wavs/01604.wav|How long is the duration of medication on annual average?
wavs/06660.wav|He was somewhat indignant and not a little hurt.
wavs/00458.wav|Why are you so tan? Oh, no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
wavs/00659.wav|What type of activities do you take part in?
wavs/00131.wav|Did he say You're not up to this again?
wavs/02888.wav|Please give details of any existing or simultaneous insurance
wavs/05552.wav|I pray you, show me What you have done.
wavs/04338.wav|Then I go to bed.
wavs/02745.wav|Let's see today's Monday
wavs/02852.wav|I wanna thank you for this opportunity.
wavs/03366.wav|They say they're bad. She thinks you're dead.
wavs/06156.wav|It isn't true. Some low scoundrel who will cast her off.
wavs/02332.wav|I screwed up my first date in nine years.
wavs/01225.wav|Any condition affecting your gall bladder, liver or pancreas for example hepatitis, fatty liver?
wavs/01528.wav|Third one tonight. Really? I had them made special.
wavs/04680.wav|We will lunch together first, and look for our friend later in the afternoon.
wavs/00272.wav|Or a hat? No, I don't want you to buy me a hat!
wavs/02138.wav|in. Hello, sweetheart.
wavs/02804.wav|How many attacks do you have per year?
wavs/02868.wav|I thought you were on my side. You're right. I mean you're right.
wavs/00126.wav|I'm free! I'm free!
wavs/01476.wav|Please. Let me do something.
wavs/05184.wav|Deliver me out of the hands of my enemies; and from them that persecute me.
wavs/01913.wav|Saltines? What?
wavs/05879.wav|Look out.
wavs/02136.wav|I should get back to work.
wavs/02628.wav|Yeah. It's been kind of quiet since Carol left. Why not get a roommate?
wavs/04834.wav|More THAN you have, perhaps.
wavs/04374.wav|I would give him the best of all blessings.
wavs/00909.wav|Since when have you been free of symptoms and free of treatment?
wavs/06217.wav|I never told her anything about her mother. That is what Dumas does.
wavs/04315.wav|Then holy priests fasted and prayed many days seeking for light, and lo!
wavs/06352.wav|I must get a move on me and turn something up for myself.
wavs/02900.wav|I think this could be, you know, it.  Really?
wavs/04311.wav|And what did you gather from it? It is easy to gather them.
wavs/01728.wav|Get down. Get down? She may not even know.
wavs/01090.wav|When did you last have skin symptoms?
wavs/00011.wav|What? You click when they click.
wavs/05443.wav|Fancy every one expected, and the table elegantly laid for the complete party.
wavs/00494.wav|When I saw you at the store last week
wavs/03771.wav|From that moment she had won her pardon.
wavs/02608.wav|The bottom line is smoking is cool
wavs/01709.wav|When will you undergo surgery?
wavs/05626.wav|So he says here. He was HEALED of all his madness.
wavs/00796.wav|So you think I'm a failure? Isn't he good?
wavs/05468.wav|Then let me add, I would willingly make the exchange!
wavs/03550.wav|What is he that you ask for, niece?
wavs/01691.wav|Which knee is affected?
wavs/05578.wav|Don't you think that Shakespeare was a great writer?
wavs/00106.wav|And then when you do, he's a preppy animal.
wavs/04285.wav|So, you see, gentlemen, you must give me a FREE hand.
wavs/03451.wav|Hate me!
wavs/04447.wav|They're waiting for you, Herrick, and you got to go; and that's a prophecy.
wavs/03407.wav|And when you turned it over the outside was a deep bronze colour.
wavs/04636.wav|For them that found the dying way to life!
wavs/00219.wav|Coming through. Move. Move!
wavs/06201.wav|And so indeed she did.
wavs/05991.wav|And the married COUPLE went to spend the honeymoon in Scotland.
wavs/01124.wav|Hey Paul
wavs/06242.wav|He was filled with a bitter sense of being entrapped.
wavs/02240.wav|Can I just say one thing?
wavs/02789.wav|and it turns out, she doesn't have a pretty face. Okay, I'm just gonna say it. Okay.
wavs/05480.wav|In this manner I secured a nice "stake" for future use. I want no doctor, now.
wavs/06626.wav|The creation of a character.
wavs/03285.wav|What is you average diving duration?
wavs/02561.wav|If you have undergone surgery what was the result?
wavs/00385.wav|They know what they do.
wavs/00630.wav|Listen it was great seeing you again. Mon easy on those cookies
wavs/00521.wav|So what have you been up to?
wavs/05429.wav|She withdrew her hands from her face, and turned suddenly toward her legal adviser.
wavs/02981.wav|I know. Well isn't that amazing?
wavs/03823.wav|They may possibly clash with more imperative considerations.
wavs/03725.wav|What Duke?
wavs/04751.wav|"Too well I know," replied Viola, "what love women may owe to men."
wavs/05923.wav|Was I speaking of you? He is better, eh?
wavs/00252.wav|Has your disorder been caused by varicose veins?
wavs/01809.wav|I said I'll take it. Here, take it. Go. Run. And on what they pay you Career.
wavs/00520.wav|Yep.
wavs/01388.wav|And this was a gift.
wavs/05447.wav|I know that James didn't do it. It hissed more furiously than ever.
wavs/05069.wav|Sir Patrick turned once more to his niece.
wavs/06205.wav|And now, my dear Mary, I must draw my letter to a close.
wavs/03960.wav|Pardon me.
wavs/06219.wav|If I asked too much of you, I was wrong.
wavs/05896.wav|She was, on the contrary, somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual.
wavs/05260.wav|She presses forward through the CROWD of Indians surrounding the stand.
wavs/05906.wav|I don't believe in tragedy. What say you of your neighbours?
wavs/00147.wav|Where are you currently working country and company name?
wavs/03664.wav|I should have mixed those new chemicals myself.
wavs/00251.wav|Like your hair for example.
wavs/03323.wav|With the socks? I figured you taught him that. No.
wavs/00198.wav|I'll pick something else up. There you go.
wavs/06398.wav|He had met the world and the world was too strong for him.
wavs/05195.wav|Why, you're an old bat! It won't do.
wavs/02699.wav|which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them. Love me! I need love! 
wavs/05936.wav|I believe you'd have died. I'll stand for it.
wavs/00794.wav|Looks like that no date pact worked out. Everybody looks so happy. I hate that!
wavs/03478.wav|It used to be two dollars in Kentucky. Silent!
wavs/06140.wav|The night is PASSED And the day is at hand.
wavs/04536.wav|My brain was utterly bewildered.
wavs/05000.wav|That is the main point to me, I assure you.
wavs/01952.wav|Ha ha
wavs/04606.wav|He had a piece of bread within reach, but how get at it?
wavs/05596.wav|Dearest Natalie!
wavs/02378.wav|Come on up. So he was a little analytical. That's what he does.
wavs/00129.wav|What's going on? Nothing.
wavs/06773.wav|They had made their Bible the great test of their liberties: will a king stand by that or will he not?
wavs/02301.wav|You know I'll be doing that at parties, right?
wavs/02307.wav|That's what I have to do.
wavs/04928.wav|But the behavior of this pew was very erratic.
wavs/03758.wav|Who dared to steal and stain the symbols of the Lord!
wavs/06815.wav|And he was useful and kind, and seemed so happy to serve you.
wavs/01364.wav|Do you drink more than twenty units of alcohol per week on a regular basis?
wavs/01638.wav|Yeah hi. I was just beeped.
wavs/05738.wav|And ten years play sad havoc with our hearts, and limbs, and all.
wavs/03286.wav|What further treatment have you undergone?
wavs/00979.wav|Let it go. It's not a big deal. We can? Okay I'm trying that.
wavs/05244.wav|Himself without fear, he yet instinctively appreciated how terrified the girl must be.
wavs/03873.wav|But love was for no market, and he who lost it lost everything.
wavs/02698.wav|Six years is long enough! What kind of change? I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
wavs/00164.wav|What was the method of treatment?
wavs/02867.wav|you gotta let them make their own mistakes.
wavs/06542.wav|Gone, sir! When the question involves the sense of HEARING some misunderstanding may be popularly assumed. The spirit of "Gil Blas" had to be cast out.
wavs/04214.wav|I to others show That mercy show to me.
wavs/00727.wav|Have you suffered from a mini stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), brain haemorrhage or surgery to your blood vessels?
wavs/04730.wav|Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.
wavs/01334.wav|It's just It's my friends.
wavs/00883.wav|these. No I'm still working on mine.
wavs/00744.wav|but I'd go for a nip. Like chasing their tail.
wavs/05760.wav|I want to speak to father about something. So you listened, did you?
wavs/04905.wav|Reason and feeling dictate it.
wavs/01315.wav|Which type of employment contract do you have?
wavs/06412.wav|Suddenly he felt that the wagon was not running true.
wavs/04210.wav|We'll drop everything else henceforth and face toward tomorrow, not yesterday.
wavs/05593.wav|She brought strange news. Delight stood poised for flight.
wavs/01182.wav|there'd be no her and your father would look like Sting. Ever since that poodle stuffer came along
wavs/05176.wav|What, what is the matter?
wavs/02987.wav|Or else I'm going to get up and go to work. Wish me luck! What for?
wavs/06097.wav|The key hung to the box by a string.
wavs/05653.wav|And for another thing, they do certainly help my memory.
wavs/03215.wav|When were you diagnosed with this condition?
wavs/03541.wav|I KILLED him because he was a wild beast.
wavs/00290.wav|How did it go? Not so good.
wavs/02686.wav|What exact activities do you practice? Please indicate the kind of motor cycle, races, rallies, annual frequency, participation in competitions, etc.
wavs/06459.wav|Besides now, what customs has he put down?
wavs/00613.wav|Come on. Just do it. No, interestingly, her leaf blower picked up.
wavs/03098.wav|Hey, everybody, the ball is dropping. What?
wavs/00178.wav|Oh that's fine
wavs/04711.wav|Oh, the generous hopes and aspirations of forty years ago!
wavs/02088.wav|When were your last symptoms?
wavs/01215.wav|Do you do one of the above mentioned types of diving for occupational reasons?
wavs/05624.wav|I leave you to consider this. "You are talking nonsense," she said; "and you must go to bed."
wavs/04178.wav|This magnificent building was the realization of the present.
wavs/01854.wav|Please indicate the reasons for your occupational change
wavs/04377.wav|Now get!
wavs/00337.wav|What was the result of the urinalysis?
wavs/01615.wav|I did. I think so.
wavs/00624.wav|What? Didn't you get a good enough look the other day?
wavs/02754.wav|I feel so
wavs/00563.wav|There's some creep out there with a telescope!
wavs/00621.wav|Bye bye. Oh God!
wavs/01920.wav|Which therapy have you undergone?
wavs/02244.wav|How much alcohol did you drink in the past?
wavs/04759.wav|Guess that beats all records! Then you'll go!
wavs/05944.wav|And where will you get the sugar? It's all the same!
wavs/00849.wav|You're gonna make a great dad.
wavs/03924.wav|What pastimes are they? Had he been wanting in prudence?
wavs/06325.wav|I missed her when we came out on the terrace.
wavs/05112.wav|It used to speak to me so eloquently when it spoke of his love.
wavs/04249.wav|But was it not still possible that this fog might turn to rain?
wavs/01497.wav|I hope you can find a way to be happy for me.
wavs/06681.wav|His aunt died a few years ago. And me.
wavs/00373.wav|Fasten your seat belts, it's pee pee time.
wavs/04373.wav|So he told her with much amusing detail after his fashion.
wavs/01365.wav|Didn't you listen to the story? I had trouble with it at first. But I get all the good stuff.
wavs/05316.wav|How cheerfully on the false trail they cry.
wavs/02496.wav|I'm sorry. I don't get it. What happened?
wavs/05968.wav|Let me see what you have got in your pockets.
wavs/04896.wav|But I may at least WARN you to carry the matter no further.
wavs/06065.wav|She rose and advanced eagerly, with a faint tinge of color in her cheeks.
wavs/05043.wav|All was dull and vulgar.
wavs/03628.wav|The outside show of things is of very small account.
wavs/01306.wav|Does he sell it drink it?
wavs/01304.wav|Come on! We were great together.
wavs/00870.wav|What about you?
wavs/00468.wav|It's textbook. Hey you guys.
wavs/02889.wav|Do you still have symptoms?
wavs/04599.wav|Dispatched!
wavs/02489.wav|What joints are involved?
wavs/03059.wav|Really? Well, at least big girls don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
wavs/05668.wav|If in a "quick temper," you are likely to say things you afterwards regret. I forgot to order the CONFOUNDED dinner!
wavs/05484.wav|Remember, the SOIL is generous.
wavs/05326.wav|Cora laughed.
wavs/03802.wav|Now I'm going to put a head on you.
wavs/04489.wav|He felt more for his son than before. Generally they were books of travel.
wavs/02607.wav|When did you first have your allergy?
wavs/03981.wav|These few records show how useless comparative scores may be.
wavs/01587.wav|What bank is this?
wavs/00405.wav|You were incredible. Thank you. I could not have done this without you.
wavs/03901.wav|Night always found him at home, warm, well fed, content, and at peace.
wavs/00188.wav|Which other races or events do you participate in?
wavs/03681.wav|One of the gentlemen is the lady's husband.
wavs/00711.wav|I can't believe you would actually say that. He's gotta be, like, the toughest snack there is.
wavs/01897.wav|What's wrong? Why so scrunchie? That guy he burns me up.
wavs/05360.wav|The cart was conquered, the drunken man was taken prisoner.
wavs/04691.wav|This is the worst species; hypocrisy enters into it. Where should he take her?
wavs/03339.wav|Soon his keen eye recognized the swing of the rider in his saddle.
wavs/01979.wav|Please state the name of your company
wavs/02567.wav|You think I should? I really do. But could we not go together?
wavs/02898.wav|What is the cause of your disability?
wavs/04723.wav|For an instant Colonel Ashley hesitated in his hiding place.
wavs/00594.wav|Which other motor car sport do take part in?
wavs/05858.wav|But you never turn to at it, Biddy.
wavs/00216.wav|I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?
wavs/02894.wav|Are you welling up? No.
wavs/04168.wav|But in ARTS mechanical no citizens may compare with these.
wavs/04980.wav|In fact, there are hardly any houses at all.
wavs/02862.wav|Look! I cleaned!
wavs/06144.wav|Save for unexpected deep holes one COULD wade across it anywhere.
wavs/04020.wav|I was with father, you know, when mother was married to Lin that time.
wavs/00920.wav|As far as I know
wavs/00259.wav|Are you a member in an organisation which controls these activities?
wavs/02978.wav|Okay, so I'm responsible. I'm organized.
wavs/00733.wav|No problem.
wavs/01822.wav|I'm sorry. Ma! What are you doing here? I came to give you this and this!
wavs/00639.wav|You know? In fact she.
wavs/01449.wav|Did he say You're not up to this again? I got the extended version with choruses of
wavs/04513.wav|If you only knew how we MISSED you yesterday!
wavs/02354.wav|I helped.
wavs/01654.wav|I'm going out with more people than her.
wavs/01466.wav|and you had no friends, you were just fine.
wavs/03398.wav|You understand, Father Madeleine, the government will notice it.
wavs/04488.wav|She wrote the letter, then, in his apartments.
wavs/03959.wav|Why, it's a crying shame.
wavs/03879.wav|I will prove it! I considered with myself.
wavs/04251.wav|The sea became heavier and heavier, and the wind more and more violent.
wavs/02253.wav|Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?
wavs/03169.wav|Okay relax.
wavs/00310.wav|I'm sorry it didn't work out.
wavs/01760.wav|You have no respect for privacy. No, you wait! Can I just say one thing? What?!
wavs/06105.wav|Tis Lizzy. It was the stand of a rocket.
wavs/05921.wav|A young girl, you know, is something like a temple.
wavs/04900.wav|Various tastes and different ages found their wishes equally consulted here.
wavs/01136.wav|You're not a senior?
wavs/04641.wav|Neither Hector nor Jenny doubted that they formed the general topic of conversation.
wavs/03400.wav|Some way she doesn't seem like the same woman.
wavs/00738.wav|Maybe not.
wavs/05783.wav|No, nothing shall pass my lips. Curious magic of thought!
wavs/05028.wav|Oh, cousin!
wavs/03569.wav|All these are active PROCEEDINGS. There was no water left.
wavs/00379.wav|You're the one that hires them and fires them. They say you're a great boss.
wavs/01972.wav|Remember when you were a kid, we'd go see the big ships in the navy yard?
wavs/02470.wav|I'm so sorry! It's just my lens. It's my lens.
wavs/03203.wav|What kind of vehicle do you drive
wavs/04577.wav|We drew circles round his freedom, smaller and smaller.
wavs/01903.wav|There you go. Ooh I'm alive with pleasure now.
wavs/02291.wav|Which? Which what?
wavs/06094.wav|Strength is left me still. Still we found it true.
wavs/05666.wav|Mrs. Godwin pursued the fugitives to Calais, but in vain.
wavs/06344.wav|I can just feel myself getting greasy. O Hero!
wavs/06564.wav|Very well, let it be South America! It is quite true. She's coming, Johnny.
wavs/06603.wav|"But, Ready," said Captain Osborn, "why do you think that we shall have a shift of wind?"
wavs/06819.wav|He forced their conversion to a nominal Christianity.
wavs/00144.wav|I gave up, like, everything. And for what? Right. He gave up something but then he got those magic beans.
wavs/02063.wav|Big day. I mean, he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat.
wavs/06262.wav|Mark! What do you say, dear? Well, how is Annie?
wavs/02175.wav|Do you want anything else? Nothing. I'm fine.
wavs/04504.wav|But I may get something.
wavs/02090.wav|Do you still suffer from impaired hearing?
wavs/00518.wav|No idea. Look how much they spent.
wavs/02614.wav|What complications did you suffer from?
wavs/03125.wav|You've got to do something about that.
wavs/04173.wav|His room was cold, but he was oppressed by heat.
wavs/05493.wav|What arises from right or wrong action does not matter.
wavs/00936.wav|I know. That's what I told her.
wavs/04331.wav|The land of death spread its cruel net around him.
wavs/06714.wav|And, in good time, here comes the noble duke. I can't part with her.
wavs/00948.wav|What competitive events do you take part in?
wavs/06556.wav|O PULSE of my life!
wavs/06375.wav|The policeman opened the door of the cab and stepped in.
wavs/06379.wav|With us it is not so. Princes would fight one another for you.
wavs/01272.wav|That would be great! But make sure it seems like you're there to see him.
wavs/03200.wav|why didn't I get the honey glazed ham.
wavs/05221.wav|Do you mean to say that she has left already?
wavs/05371.wav|But then the trouble, the inconvenience to yourself!
wavs/06101.wav|Certainly, dear; above all things in the world. The sea is the vast RESERVOIR of Nature.
wavs/00187.wav|This is like a reunion in the hall!
wavs/01402.wav|Uh oh. What?
wavs/04492.wav|It also spake a few words concerning his fathers.
wavs/04804.wav|I am not angry; I am very calm.
wavs/05919.wav|You are a most FEARFUL man. By the land.
wavs/02662.wav|Let her know I like her? Are you insane?
wavs/02134.wav|Do you expect changes in your activities in the next two years?
wavs/04183.wav|All I had hitherto heard of Christian theology had alienated me from it.
wavs/04883.wav|Sleep was not much in my way that night.
wavs/05180.wav|The students were greatly amused to see the matter taken in this way.
wavs/06481.wav|Of these, by far the most CELEBRATED is that of the Bank Porters.
wavs/03596.wav|Its cushioned back stopped just at the point where the head found needed support.
wavs/05127.wav|Sal blushed.
wavs/03801.wav|The ground continued to be marked with very large footprints.
wavs/02379.wav|I think it'll be fine. It will not. We'll get in trouble.
wavs/04891.wav|Madam How is digging away with her soft SPADE, water.
wavs/05584.wav|He followed them into the library, leading Grace after him by the hand.
wavs/05109.wav|What is this huge creature who lies here on the sand?
wavs/04414.wav|My task was to interest men in the abstract problems of child education.
wavs/05891.wav|Unhappy mortals!
wavs/02289.wav|I have a jam packed schedule.
wavs/05228.wav|Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you.
wavs/02932.wav|I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
wavs/06011.wav|And in this weather! Of what good is this?
wavs/06196.wav|I had a long talk with Mr. Hale this afternoon.
wavs/01697.wav|I'm very aware of my tongue. Come on. Here goes.
wavs/05914.wav|I gave her back the letter in silence.
wavs/05637.wav|The quantity of beer consumed in those days was indeed enormous.
wavs/04949.wav|He did his work, year in and year out, and asked no favors.
wavs/02310.wav|Uh oh
wavs/03490.wav|You are my executor; take what you like; help yourself.
wavs/06693.wav|Oh yes?
wavs/04232.wav|Where do they touch, where cover each other?
wavs/06562.wav|See how I kill the time when the time parts us.
wavs/01750.wav|I want you to know, I didn't turn you in. Thanks. No, thank you.
wavs/04225.wav|No extraneous interest could distract his attention; not for a moment.
wavs/04165.wav|Henry suggested.
wavs/03517.wav|Still I hesitated, for I mistrusted me of this business.
wavs/03263.wav|So you can tell?
wavs/05364.wav|My children! Let's be sociable.
wavs/04852.wav|I know myself, and he was wanting to speak, but he gave himself airs.
wavs/05310.wav|What whale? She shut her eyes to make sure.
wavs/02809.wav|Barbecue. Oh, did I? See, there you go.
wavs/04592.wav|Historians generally give most weight to the latter.
wavs/04295.wav|You're in good company. I forget all else.
wavs/00598.wav|Oh no!
wavs/03194.wav|Do you plan any occupational change or have you been advised to?
wavs/03403.wav|In what, then, had I sinned? I only ask leave to explain myself.
wavs/06384.wav|Yes; come to think of it, I know it does.
wavs/01617.wav|Are you experiencing any symptoms or complaints for which you have not yet consulted any kind of doctor, nurse or specialist?
wavs/04585.wav|No, let the thing work, let the rumor spread quietly. I couldn't tell.
wavs/05200.wav|And I saw Scipio bend closer to his cooking.
wavs/02131.wav|Are you awaiting surgery for this complaint?
wavs/05836.wav|In WHICH, sir? She half rose in her chair.
wavs/06113.wav|She was just touching his forehead with her lips.
wavs/04079.wav|And bowing themselves, they made obeisance to him.
wavs/02046.wav|No. No resentment. Believe me
wavs/03495.wav|The wife!
wavs/02596.wav|Thanks. You're a good kid.
wavs/03457.wav|He went to the door, looked in, and shut it again.
wavs/06092.wav|She seemed both to respect himself and her position as his lady and spouse.
wavs/00752.wav|Listen to me!
wavs/01165.wav|I don't sound Like that. That is so not true. That is so not That is so not
wavs/05533.wav|The man was not asleep, but nothing could arouse him.
wavs/05339.wav|The slaughter in London was about to begin.
wavs/00555.wav|I won't talk to her. She got my message
wavs/02899.wav|I don't see it!
wavs/00296.wav|Thanks Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.
wavs/05320.wav|Pray you, be gone. So you do not propose to exercise your option?
wavs/04103.wav|But, after all, I am at hand. A valuable citizen. Oh, my darling!
wavs/06718.wav|My lady turned as though to speak to him.
wavs/06179.wav|All habits, good or bad, are the result of what you will to do.
wavs/01889.wav|Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas. I'm in Las Vegas.
wavs/01726.wav|How often have you been diving and how often do you indent to dive in the future?
wavs/00209.wav|You push me away, you pull me back!
wavs/05833.wav|Anne wiped off the obvious places on the furniture.
wavs/01267.wav|Hey Brian.
wavs/03162.wav|You did so I swear to
wavs/03523.wav|What a reason for lasting! No, I'm going, sure.
wavs/00913.wav|not worth it. This is not that bad.
wavs/00320.wav|I got on the subway.
wavs/00359.wav|You know, you were right. I thought we were happy.
wavs/02370.wav|You were great! But they still made fun of you.
wavs/04209.wav|Hu!
wavs/00923.wav|Can I talk to you for a second? Over there?
wavs/00914.wav|Are you currently being treated or have you ever been treated by a doctor?
wavs/02437.wav|So you guys really slide down a pole?
wavs/00585.wav|All right. There's a theory put forth by Richard Leakey
wavs/03133.wav|Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
wavs/04850.wav|I have my own reasons for producing this document.
wavs/03799.wav|That is now answered. No one can imagine where he got the pull.
wavs/03891.wav|I looked about, but could not see the speaker. You will find "Beginning Point" there. Did I plan the deception?
wavs/04370.wav|I concluded I would give up the whole business.
wavs/03193.wav|How you get any work done is beyond me.
wavs/00268.wav|Thanks. What?
wavs/02684.wav|Then you say that you have to go
wavs/03266.wav|Maybe we could get together later? That sounds good. I'll call you. Or you call me, whatever.
wavs/06241.wav|He is gone? I go!
wavs/00826.wav|Here goes.
wavs/01030.wav|Oh good. Who are they?
wavs/02344.wav|And I was blowing my attack whistle thingy
wavs/06378.wav|Some buildings THAT withstood the shocks were destroyed by fire.
wavs/00877.wav|Come on in. Thanks. Like five minutes.
wavs/05925.wav|Should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism?
wavs/00596.wav|Excuse me! I was kind of using that machine.
wavs/01788.wav|Yes, because now I have to go down there, and deal with them. What are you talking about? Keep it!
wavs/00717.wav|What are you doing? Chopping garlic. You don't crush it?
wavs/00890.wav|A cough that's lasted for three weeks or more?
wavs/04596.wav|Thus, then, in brief; The valiant PARIS seeks you for his love. He caught the rope.
wavs/03583.wav|I was absorbed in the magnificent promise of the mines.
wavs/03445.wav|Have you not set them on? In the larger places they both preached.
wavs/04052.wav|But Sir Walter doubted. But proofs are not facts.
wavs/02939.wav|Since when are you free of symptoms and free of treatment?
wavs/04248.wav|I'm not near so tired as usual either.
wavs/04031.wav|He was a Scot, as we have said.
wavs/05003.wav|The repetition, in a woman's ear, Would murder as it fell.
wavs/03718.wav|Here sat a girl outside the door, alone.
wavs/05402.wav|He felt the rush of pain and passion.
wavs/04966.wav|With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
wavs/05981.wav|The next day, completely reconciled, they left for the country.
wavs/02578.wav|He's so sweet. And so complicated, you know? You guys want anything else?
wavs/02933.wav|four three
wavs/06430.wav|The last two words were scarcely legible. Herbert approached Sydney.
wavs/01674.wav|How long? Two years. Wow.
wavs/03121.wav|You know, day and night. And night and day.
wavs/05918.wav|We may do business together.
wavs/05787.wav|Always. Shall I be heard?
wavs/04567.wav|An icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room.
wavs/01266.wav|How long did you stay there?
wavs/02940.wav|You chose the out of work actor business.
wavs/05577.wav|Right or wrong, this was his personal feeling. You UNDERSTAND that, do you not?
wavs/01936.wav|Do you regularly participate in diving examinations?
wavs/01623.wav|You don't say. Who? Me!
wavs/00000.wav|Please give details of treatment
wavs/06713.wav|The Rev. Paul Ford looked up now, very quickly.
wavs/03973.wav|A house collapsed with a crash just behind us.
wavs/06638.wav|Andrew did not like the President. You're needed here.
wavs/06741.wav|But he has vanished from among his brethren, none knows how or whither.
wavs/04309.wav|Haven't you just said it concerned me from beginning to end?
wavs/03115.wav|We'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
wavs/05198.wav|That's false. The detective was right. Anne remained silent.
wavs/01719.wav|I'm here. You are?
wavs/03120.wav|There's chicken in there. Put it away.
wavs/01508.wav|You kidding? The guy's a freak. I judge him. Hey, man! Hey, buddy!
wavs/02135.wav|It's worse when you're twins. You're a twin? We don't speak.
wavs/02076.wav|Hey. It's him.
wavs/00805.wav|Tonight. Man, what are the odds of that happening?
wavs/06173.wav|Preach the Gospel WITH my sword, Or be brought back in my shroud!
wavs/03502.wav|He was never angry, domineering, sneering or insulting.
wavs/03438.wav|How is half such a sum to be repaid?
wavs/00940.wav|Right? I mean this woman was
wavs/03506.wav|All the wrinkles on her face were in straight lines.
wavs/03332.wav|What are you talking about?
wavs/02398.wav|No. What? It says I'm a sensitive, warm kind of guy.
wavs/05920.wav|With all my WISDOM, I do not know.
wavs/06003.wav|I found no one in America who did.
wavs/03187.wav|Is your condition completely cured?
wavs/03546.wav|"Lead on," they shouted, as he finished his brief but animating address, "lead on wherever you think best."
wavs/03513.wav|He recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless.
wavs/03086.wav|Did you suffer from the following symptoms?
wavs/03027.wav|Are you guys gonna be okay?
wavs/03068.wav|Till I get back some of my massage clients. Pirates again?
wavs/02280.wav|Are you gonna
wavs/03124.wav|So then how could you? Do you remember how your father used to be?
wavs/02688.wav|Services?
wavs/01718.wav|Indeed there isn't
wavs/04833.wav|The passion increased from day to day. But you've got to, just the same.
wavs/04361.wav|Nearly six.
wavs/02380.wav|How long do or did your symptoms last for?
wavs/03014.wav|Why should they meet him?
wavs/03949.wav|That's all that I don't like about it.
wavs/02947.wav|Why don't?
wavs/05748.wav|She caught her breath and sobbed wildly for a moment.
wavs/00042.wav|Come on. She'll be here any minute.
wavs/02969.wav|Hit the lights please. How long was I in there?
wavs/05177.wav|Very well, later, but you must certainly tell me.
wavs/02453.wav|if someone had come to me with the idea
wavs/06821.wav|The halls are a labyrinth.
wavs/02517.wav|Pretty well actually.
wavs/00010.wav|Yeah well
wavs/02577.wav|fall in love and that'd be it? Man I never thought I'd be here.
wavs/04616.wav|Don't you stir! The valet hastened to obey the call.
wavs/01443.wav|Do you still have any symptoms or complication?
wavs/05960.wav|Bring Lincoln there the first unto the tree.
wavs/00366.wav|Yeah. They even do you. They do me?
wavs/02165.wav|I can't not see it now. Hey kids!
wavs/02708.wav|Have you been advised to change your occupation because of your disorder?
wavs/00531.wav|When did you last have a urinalysis?
wavs/05328.wav|Shall I go away and let you go to bed?
wavs/06565.wav|And almost at the same moment Mr Moss was announced.
wavs/02341.wav|We hate him!
wavs/00525.wav|Which ear is affected?
wavs/00643.wav|Hey, hey, hey, hey! Quit making up rules!
wavs/06039.wav|I lived?
wavs/04312.wav|All men there have gold! Good sir, have patience.
wavs/06679.wav|I wasn't manager at first.
wavs/02104.wav|Are your hands still wet? They're moist. Let's dry them again.
wavs/03560.wav|The half a sovereign, and the gallon can.
wavs/00833.wav|Unexplained bleeding, weight loss, lump or growth, mole or freckle that's bled or changed in appearance?
wavs/02910.wav|Not everybody is happy. Hey Bobby!
wavs/03729.wav|His forehead is prematurely bald.
wavs/04181.wav|I need no one. THAT'S not all the truth, either.
wavs/03538.wav|"But at night," said the artful duke, who was now coming to the drift of his discourse, "her doors are fast locked."
wavs/05015.wav|I have a word to say to Jarvis.
wavs/00438.wav|No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. Do you have any respect for your body?
wavs/03250.wav|they've already thrown caution to the wind. That's me.
wavs/01841.wav|There has to be something wrong with him.
wavs/03636.wav|They were on to us just the same.
wavs/01712.wav|I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff.
wavs/04174.wav|In long, echoing streets I would laugh and shout.
wavs/04780.wav|These things I am prepared to explain if need be.
wavs/04881.wav|Give it to them. The girl said so anyway.
wavs/03659.wav|The ribbon of the Legion of honor was in his buttonhole.
wavs/06155.wav|Where be these enemies? There's another! Yes, this afternoon.
wavs/02151.wav|And sometimes when it's freezing
wavs/00018.wav|All right. And my dead mother said you are it. I'm with Rachel.
wavs/01122.wav|All right there you go. This way. Here you go.
wavs/00820.wav|I'm sorry. So you're widowed? Hopefully?
wavs/03653.wav|There ain't any gold here.
wavs/04170.wav|She obeyed without speaking, and shut the door again.
wavs/04004.wav|Willie raised his hat, and we walked away.
wavs/04241.wav|The post arrived, and brought no reply from Sir Patrick.
wavs/06684.wav|And what knowledge ought we to acquire? They do so.
wavs/05311.wav|The snake!
wavs/03380.wav|Glee, joy. Give it me, for Christ's sake! We make light of sin.
wavs/05251.wav|Haven't you a wife, or some good friend?
wavs/02492.wav|I'll take a look at him. Thank you.
wavs/02872.wav|There's something so sweet
wavs/06701.wav|Besides being automatic the camera could be worked by hand.
wavs/02717.wav|Fine. Fine. What four of us?
wavs/05355.wav|But does not this line become doubled if we add another such line here?
wavs/05846.wav|What I felt and feared in this miserable state of things matters little.
wavs/00491.wav|Now she's passed.
wavs/04739.wav|Really it isn't worth your making all this fuss about.
wavs/03872.wav|And that won't be for many a mile, kid.
wavs/05369.wav|From whence?
wavs/04877.wav|I hope I have not become a negro.
wavs/03011.wav|Of course it was a line. Is it me?
wavs/05576.wav|It was a lucky day for me when you borrowed it.
wavs/00614.wav|Yes, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair. So did she?
wavs/00394.wav|You know Like
wavs/02423.wav|I told her you have a restaurant
wavs/02466.wav|What's the matter? Oh, it's Marcel.
wavs/01157.wav|What is the exact diagnosis?
wavs/02018.wav|Oh no
wavs/02799.wav|I know. He's so sweet. And so complicated, you know? Think you'll do it on his couch?
wavs/01795.wav|Then you say, I have no choice. Can't you understand that? And I say, No! No! I can't understand that!
wavs/00969.wav|We are gonna be here a while, it looks like. Oh God!
wavs/01086.wav|Well, some people are gonna be working
wavs/05304.wav|I know, Mr. Franklin, that you have got at the truth at last.
wavs/02943.wav|It's just. I hate that guy! Hello dear!
wavs/04884.wav|A rebel is a man who fights against his king and his country.
wavs/02497.wav|What other activity do you do?
wavs/01573.wav|What?! What? That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your
wavs/06700.wav|Life has necessities to which we must all submit.
wavs/05242.wav|The finishing polish is now to be given.
wavs/05634.wav|Well, I guess it's going to come out all right in the end.
wavs/00213.wav|so I really know exactly how you feel.
wavs/01332.wav|Do you suffer from asthmatic complaints or asthma?
wavs/02111.wav|She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me. Look at this. Look. She buys tickets to plays I wanna see.
wavs/00823.wav|Last night was great.
wavs/00838.wav|We're with you. We got it.
wavs/05345.wav|Adams's calculation was first begun and first completed.
wavs/03824.wav|Thomson stood up for a moment and looked around.
wavs/03788.wav|I don't know what it may be worth.
wavs/01222.wav|Congratulations! This is so exciting! It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
wavs/03136.wav|Was that not clear? Why don't?
wavs/00982.wav|I'm gonna get another espresso. More latte? No I'm still working on mine.
wavs/04895.wav|The riders! Blanche started, and trembled. Thanks, no.
wavs/00741.wav|Oh, God! You guys want me to take this back?
wavs/05607.wav|I dare say you found it so, too?
wavs/04989.wav|Again he called her, and she cried her PRESENCE loudly in his ear.
wavs/01501.wav|Do you ride your mountain bike for pleasure only?
wavs/04602.wav|There is a moral situation here which must be solved.
wavs/02826.wav|I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't being clear. This was our cart.
wavs/02645.wav|I wanted her to think I might be in a restaurant
wavs/06299.wav|Suddenly he stopped, and hastily entered the next room.
wavs/02156.wav|What is your highest altitude achieved?
wavs/01816.wav|I mean, what about you? Me? I'm fine.
wavs/05479.wav|Once grasp that; and the allegory becomes simple enough.
wavs/04764.wav|How beautiful it is! "And do you know," I added, "what has been the result since men have almost entirely annihilated this useful race?" Other leaders have maintained orders as strict.
wavs/00554.wav|Why? I have my reasons.
wavs/05318.wav|A friend?
wavs/01832.wav|Hold on. You knew? Of course I knew. What do you think? You should've heard his stories.
wavs/03811.wav|I didn't do so, because you seemed so frightened, poor darling!
wavs/05563.wav|"Their virginity is an object of traffic," we are told, "quoted on the EXCHANGE of infamy."
wavs/01821.wav|What other symptoms do you suffer from or which other organs are involved?
wavs/05761.wav|I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word to stay within.
wavs/01971.wav|the bus stop. I'm fine.
wavs/03074.wav|Since when have you been suffering from thyroid disease?
wavs/00775.wav|Please give details of this allergy
wavs/03512.wav|At some points there the ashes were ten feet deep.
wavs/01958.wav|It's the next day. How needy do I wanna seem?
wavs/06178.wav|The Inevitable Necessity it broken. True, Master Page.
wavs/04624.wav|She yielded: it was plainly useless to resist.
wavs/00006.wav|Yeah. Maybe.
wavs/05886.wav|Billy THOUGHT for a moment.
wavs/03251.wav|God! Can you stop yelling? You're making me nervous and.
wavs/02692.wav|What is the cause for the loss?
wavs/01175.wav|And I got you
wavs/00549.wav|Do you suffer from any other disorders or consequences as
wavs/01732.wav|So are you gonna call him?
wavs/02024.wav|What is the purpose of the cover?
wavs/00925.wav|who I don't talk to anymore
wavs/00580.wav|He's our age. When we were.
wavs/00440.wav|You know, you read about it. You see it in the movies.
wavs/02219.wav|He's sweet but it's not fun anymore.
wavs/02308.wav|I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. Oh by the way
wavs/03020.wav|And that's when I knew. Eat your fish.
wavs/04732.wav|David WOULD ask her breathlessly.
wavs/04082.wav|She's COMING to the bed.
wavs/01017.wav|Please enter the specific country names
wavs/03017.wav|I told everybody about this. Everybody will be expecting to see me.
wavs/05103.wav|I know not why he should so single me out for such an honor.
wavs/03576.wav|From the court her family is, and friends from the Emperor, und alles.
wavs/02818.wav|Okay. I'll miss you.
wavs/01636.wav|Oh no! I'm sorry you misunderstood.
wavs/06009.wav|She raised herself eagerly in the chair. And he's going back with me.
wavs/04263.wav|What have you got to say to me?
wavs/05979.wav|Well, it was good of you to want to help him.
wavs/00786.wav|Do you still have any pain or restriction in movement in your shoulders?
wavs/02988.wav|Do you have a point? You know you'd think I would.
wavs/01872.wav|so they'd favor you.
wavs/05674.wav|No, no, not THAT, Mary!
wavs/00628.wav|Which type of mountaineering do you practice?
wavs/06536.wav|You don't mean that I've driven her away?
wavs/00816.wav|We just got the message. Is he okay?
wavs/06138.wav|Look well!
wavs/03335.wav|The sooner the better, madam.
wavs/01119.wav|Don't listen to her. You've always been independent.
wavs/03518.wav|Now is Mortimer lord of this city. Drive them away!
wavs/03696.wav|But, indeed, none of my treasures here have cost me anything.
wavs/00408.wav|I didn't say any I did not say anything. I swear.
wavs/00626.wav|Have you had a brain surgery for your epilepsy?
wavs/04802.wav|But herself she wrought deliverance, and devised a great comfort.
wavs/01054.wav|What is or was the cause of your disorder?
wavs/01005.wav|Really? Let's compare shall we?
wavs/00728.wav|But I don't see it. You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now.
wavs/05418.wav|We do not cry and weep: we sit down with cold eyes and look at the world.
wavs/02604.wav|You are not still going over that thing. This woman's living my life. What?
wavs/00527.wav|That's nice. No no. With him.
wavs/03999.wav|You have no need to tell me that.
wavs/02306.wav|I'm out of order? You're out of order!
wavs/00061.wav|Everybody having fun at the party?
wavs/01844.wav|and he was really tender. Come on baby
wavs/00511.wav|It's like we were never apart. Of course, we were, but Forgive and forget.
wavs/05736.wav|In other words, we must trace the evolution of the art of writing.
wavs/06719.wav|It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which.
wavs/03289.wav|Hey you're gonna be fine.
wavs/03025.wav|And it turns out it's my mother. Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.
wavs/00304.wav|Well I don't know. Why?
wavs/01245.wav|You're right. We saw your head. How about that accent?
wavs/06394.wav|For weeks he would remain without seeing the face of a male creature.
wavs/01968.wav|What did they do to you? It's nothing, it's just Okay. I'm going through my mail,
wavs/04402.wav|It was like a boiling kettle or the bubbling of some great pot.
wavs/04188.wav|You were once a gentleman. I like Julia best.
wavs/04356.wav|The sooner to effect what I intended. And to what are they like?
wavs/00691.wav|Come on up.
wavs/00798.wav|It was hard. His kids liked me better than him. Nothing.
wavs/04543.wav|Who wandered like a ghost without a home.
wavs/05855.wav|Did you mention Professor Burgess?
wavs/05893.wav|You lie in your throat.
wavs/04359.wav|We must come for a row some day.
wavs/05512.wav|Lacking an education, I was unprepared to say.
wavs/03602.wav|It was a vain attempt.
wavs/05454.wav|I had no weapon, not even a stick.
wavs/02562.wav|What treatment are you receiving in the last twelve months or currently?
wavs/04642.wav|Elizabeth was FORCED to go.
wavs/04920.wav|Is it not all a question of circumstance and blood?
wavs/01570.wav|This is probably for the best.
wavs/02171.wav|Do you know any disturbance or disorder of your immune system?
wavs/01087.wav|She wants to see me tomorrow.
wavs/02541.wav|Beads of condensation are inching their way closer to the wood.
wavs/06764.wav|Lincoln was at City Point when Petersburg fell.
wavs/06183.wav|And yet no matter; why should we go in? An inventory must suffice.
wavs/03617.wav|They that were kings in Babylon were wise MEN, master.
wavs/05953.wav|In my Father's house there are many mansions.
wavs/03348.wav|Riddle me that. It may be important. He is struck down; low, and hardly to rise.
wavs/03753.wav|Bye, Rama, see you next time. Oh, yes, Aunt Polly.
wavs/00324.wav|That's nice twice. Where have you been?
wavs/03779.wav|Why, a hundred head is a big steal.
wavs/05064.wav|That was very unsatisfactory. With the passage of each day he felt more secure.
wavs/06671.wav|Daybreak appeared. He was at the window, kicking the wall. This?
wavs/02304.wav|And the most enjoyable. Phoebe say something.
wavs/06257.wav|Frau Orme, not? It was a talk that meant a lot to me.
wavs/04128.wav|Now do stop scowling, and smile for the lady.
wavs/06209.wav|The farmer stared past him into the house.
wavs/01079.wav|When was your last symptom?
wavs/03156.wav|that I might touch thy cheek.
wavs/06675.wav|"That's not my business," grumbled the coachman; "ring the bell in the hall for Sebastian." You're just angry because he called you Doc.
wavs/03084.wav|Rach are you gonna separate those? Oh God.
wavs/03225.wav|What kind of race do you do?
wavs/05140.wav|I suppose I ought to tell you. The Evil Eye was on them; that is true.
wavs/04649.wav|He sat down again, and bent forward. In the Transvaal.
wavs/03130.wav|On average how long would you use your medication each year?
wavs/00214.wav|Would you like my tin foil hat?
wavs/04765.wav|Bassett was the first to break the silence.
wavs/03147.wav|At least there's no new way. I just don't think things are gonna work out.
wavs/06500.wav|If you have any wish on such subjects, do not conceal it from me.
wavs/01556.wav|All right! Come on! Let's play Twister!
wavs/00644.wav|Don't you think maybe it's just that he's so perceptive
wavs/06437.wav|Suddenly the clouds seemed real.
wavs/04643.wav|"You know how I constantly expose myself," said he, "once more or less does not matter much."
wavs/02513.wav|I just can't stand your friends.
wavs/05106.wav|He is a father at least; and will have decency, if not humanity.
wavs/03663.wav|My contributions might be likened to their swan songs.
wavs/05824.wav|The rector had been thinking.
wavs/05982.wav|I have often smiled as I looked back on it.
wavs/00825.wav|While Daryl is beautiful in a conventional way
wavs/05120.wav|Up from the dwellings of the sons of men.
wavs/00756.wav|It was unbelievable! I've never met anyone like her. She's had an amazing life!
wavs/02771.wav|Oh that is so sweet!
wavs/02328.wav|Why not? Was I doing something particularly saucy? You were not the only one there.
wavs/02312.wav|Oh my God! I'm so sorry!
wavs/00832.wav|Which of the following related to you?
wavs/04469.wav|It was my turn, now, to enlighten Ezra Jennings.
wavs/04185.wav|I dream I'm on a horse's back, or driving him.
wavs/01574.wav|Which side of the body is involved?
wavs/00959.wav|When did you have your last allergy?
wavs/05118.wav|I call unto THEM and they stand up together.
wavs/01061.wav|What kind of license do you hold?
wavs/01716.wav|It was an accident. I wasn't across the street with a telescope. Can we change the subject please?
wavs/00548.wav|Perfect.
wavs/00505.wav|Since when do you hold this position?
wavs/02774.wav|I did.
wavs/04327.wav|The household will go into mourning eight days hence.
wavs/01596.wav|his head is flopping down Broadway, right? Oh, my God! What?

wavs/04423.wav|I always thought a great deal of poor Edward, myself.
wavs/05241.wav|He made sure he could meet it himself.
wavs/03233.wav|I hate that guy!
wavs/05457.wav|I am not thinking here of numbers. And time is at his period.
wavs/05592.wav|It had not quite steadied itself even yet.
wavs/02109.wav|In which areas do you plan to dive in the future?
wavs/04116.wav|We must scent out the truth; dig in the earth for it, and seize it.
wavs/05089.wav|The small audience tapped applause.
wavs/03252.wav|There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with. You're going out with the guy.
wavs/01493.wav|And I brought Operation. But I lost the tweezers so we can't operate.
wavs/06823.wav|Master Bernardo threw off the fever, sat up and moved about.
wavs/00581.wav|Do you go regularly to the doctor for control?
wavs/06668.wav|I only want you to know how things are.
wavs/04392.wav|I would cheer her HEART. Water your horse and be on your way.
wavs/02992.wav|we can break them up.
wavs/03410.wav|Rum? The duke wrote to her two or three times.
wavs/01164.wav|Do you attend your G P or diabetic clinic at least once a year for checkups?
wavs/02782.wav|Have you suffered from the following symptoms within the last five years
wavs/01688.wav|You just don't know you know it.
wavs/05715.wav|They had been bred in a narrow creed, both my FATHER and my mother.
wavs/03784.wav|Monsieur Becker, you will bring her, will you not?
wavs/06735.wav|Oh, then, if you could see her, and know her, as I did!
wavs/00260.wav|Third time today.
wavs/05909.wav|And where do all the vegetables come from?
wavs/02880.wav|And I got you.
wavs/05225.wav|I refuse to go and see Hamlets now.
wavs/02680.wav|You're burning your tomatoes.
wavs/05772.wav|The girl freed herself and rose to her feet.
wavs/00195.wav|floating in there, like this tiny little hitchhiker.
wavs/03941.wav|What THING is there for me to do?
wavs/02630.wav|So how'd he take it?
wavs/03765.wav|I didn't want that. Anne considered for a moment.
wavs/05419.wav|He is deep and politic.
wavs/01557.wav|Can you hear that? That'll stop when you pick up the phone.
wavs/03886.wav|If it is lewd the man was right to reject it.
wavs/00593.wav|Based on this play?
wavs/00891.wav|When was your anaemia diagnosed?
wavs/02220.wav|How long do your symptoms on average last?
wavs/03413.wav|Eh, then!
wavs/06279.wav|Plucky little chaps they are, and hardly gave a squeak.
wavs/02277.wav|I didn't tell anyone I knew you. Why not? Well because
wavs/03051.wav|Yeah you are. Remember I lived with you?
wavs/05694.wav|Thomas was now, for the moment, completely successful.
wavs/06490.wav|I am here on a very unpleasant errand.
wavs/01757.wav|He could never get a woman like that in a million years. But you always see these beautiful women with these nothing guys.
wavs/02916.wav|If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No don't do this!
wavs/04456.wav|She rose to return to light and human beings.
wavs/02460.wav|Parents can be cruel about the flatness of a child's pillow. Relax, you do this every time. The place looks great.
wavs/03582.wav|I'm earning five hundred a week right now, and doing four men's work.
wavs/06632.wav|Prehistoric history is not blotted out from Nature's laboratory.
wavs/03920.wav|What harm have I done? What does he want?
wavs/00248.wav|Excellent! We ripped that couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves.
wavs/00618.wav|What? I'm hurt.
wavs/05797.wav|Go on as you have begun. I forgot even the Little Ones: things were not amiss with them!
wavs/01346.wav|Chandler Bing, it's time to see your thing. You were supposed to be in there so I'd see your thing!
wavs/01883.wav|Please state the ages of your dependants
wavs/03305.wav|I know you did, cookie. I know you did. So tell me.

wavs/05018.wav|After his mother Eleanor's death, John ruled without her influence.
wavs/01442.wav|Right.
wavs/00180.wav|Pretty much. Most of the time. We have a kind of radar.
wavs/02626.wav|That's okay!
wavs/00332.wav|Excuse me. Gotta go.
wavs/00535.wav|No. Yeah could I just?
wavs/02951.wav|you're gonna have to take me with it!

wavs/01675.wav|What other medication are you taking?
wavs/02579.wav|Which other area?
wavs/02229.wav|I'll pick something else up. There you go. Thank you.
wavs/01044.wav|And I hit my head on the curb and cut my lip on my whistle.
wavs/04058.wav|Nothing surprised him because he lacked the faculty of surprise.
wavs/03737.wav|The Prince twirled his cane and nodded his head.
wavs/02701.wav|Can we drop this already please? Nice? They were nice?
wavs/06367.wav|The amazing interlude had commenced. She is ill.
wavs/04750.wav|Mr. Damon was continually blessing everything he could remember.
wavs/02697.wav|I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!

wavs/04530.wav|I want to speak to you about Miss Emily.
wavs/02195.wav|Well it's somewhere in between.
wavs/03615.wav|Of course, I don't want it to get about.
wavs/05356.wav|Another explanation!
wavs/00915.wav|What would make you think that? Ever since we announced the engagement, he's acted weird.
wavs/03016.wav|It wasn't that big a deal. Just socks. And a melon.
wavs/06298.wav|Did his grandchildren come to wish him length of days?
wavs/04584.wav|Mother's calling.
wavs/06060.wav|I think I may say that our trustee was surprised at something else!
wavs/02329.wav|We should really be sitting for this.
wavs/06543.wav|You fell over there and I thought you were killed.

wavs/03738.wav|That in art is highest Which aims at this.
wavs/00122.wav|You okay? I was very drunk, and it was someone else's subconscious.

wavs/04349.wav|Have you noticed that he has a leg?
wavs/05051.wav|Christopher, what are the real particulars of this business at the Yorkshire Bank?
wavs/00750.wav|Oh, him! The little guy. Oh, I love him! Wait. Wait, I see a woman. Tell me it's his mother.
wavs/04678.wav|The violence of that last prayer had burst her bonds.
wavs/06017.wav|He answered that some did and some did not.
wavs/01640.wav|Yeah! As soon as possible!
wavs/02748.wav|I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
wavs/04722.wav|It's quite another thing. The sound awoke Heidi and she opened her eyes.
wavs/00899.wav|You were a little you know.
wavs/03835.wav|There is no pride so jealous and irritable as the pride of territory.
wavs/02364.wav|It's fine. Do you want to get this part or not?
wavs/05969.wav|Tis a brave army, And full of purpose.
wavs/03142.wav|Who's to say what's true? What were you thinking? I'm not proud of this, okay?
wavs/03256.wav|Excuse me?
wavs/05151.wav|And of course he's going.
wavs/04066.wav|I'm going to make good. Which is the highest, then?
wavs/04540.wav|"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting."
wavs/06095.wav|From this point of view life is something infinitely great and infinitely little.
wavs/04219.wav|The devil take him that remembers first, I say.
wavs/00007.wav|Do you suffer limitations or disturbances in movements?
wavs/00448.wav|Absolutely. That's so cool. How do you get back up?
wavs/06324.wav|Flash followed flash, peal followed peal in quick succession.
wavs/06386.wav|Enter Hamlet, HORATIO and Marcellus.
wavs/05188.wav|In some remote provincial town, A scandalous chronicle at best!
wavs/03972.wav|But he died without ever being able to buy them.
wavs/01158.wav|So what do you think George is like? I think he's shy. Yeah.
wavs/01418.wav|It was a job! You should both know that he's a dead man.
wavs/01329.wav|Well, I guess it must have been the day after you were born.
wavs/03206.wav|I can't believe you'd actually said that.
wavs/05789.wav|Oh, father, what torture, to deceive, deceive, deceive!
wavs/05101.wav|He is close at hand, and ALWAYS at your service.
wavs/03776.wav|A second glance caused her to start, and she went to the bed.
wavs/00020.wav|I'll be right back. Okay, and we'll be here, hating you.
wavs/04394.wav|And I wish her happiness.
wavs/04252.wav|The sixth!
wavs/03562.wav|A warm wind was blowing. Deputy after Deputy shall answer to his name: Guilty or Not guilty?
wavs/03699.wav|The young men were comrades; the young girls were friends.
wavs/05720.wav|I cannot let young ladies meddle WITH my documents.
wavs/00166.wav|Do you hold a valid diving certificate?
wavs/03216.wav|You have me. No. Just you. Like all of them?

wavs/01373.wav|in.
wavs/06150.wav|The explanation might, in either case, be the right one.
wavs/03595.wav|This orient pearl: his speech sticks in my heart.
wavs/01410.wav|Do you have a length adjustment?
wavs/02744.wav|Could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you.
wavs/04773.wav|My name is hurt, the truth is wounded! And promise them success and victory.
wavs/02265.wav|Thanks. Let's keep going.
wavs/04481.wav|You don't carry a comb, my man, when you bathe?
wavs/05114.wav|She had been advertised, without result, in the Glasgow newspapers.
wavs/05297.wav|You are attractive, very attractive.
wavs/05128.wav|No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
wavs/02758.wav|You see actually
wavs/01522.wav|Do you visit your doctor regularly regarding the control of this condition?
wavs/03140.wav|Except for the red sock, which is still red.
wavs/02022.wav|Has your disorder or complaint been caused by an allergy?
wavs/05907.wav|The one act is melodrama, the other farce.
wavs/02211.wav|How many have you had? I don't know. A million! I'm fine, I'm fine. All right.
wavs/04286.wav|The weight of evidence is VERY much on the other side.
wavs/00352.wav|Let's say you and I give it another shot.
wavs/03284.wav|Is it like, a little annoying? Or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
wavs/05587.wav|How those two love each other! "HAIL," said they, "to the Other with the Whip!"
wavs/05535.wav|Who is, when the object of them is so fair?
wavs/05170.wav|No, nonsense!
wavs/04487.wav|The tone of steady conviction in which she spoke alarmed and distressed me.
wavs/04598.wav|I would wake him first, and then kill him.
wavs/00078.wav|Yes, we'll be right down. Thank you.
wavs/01909.wav|During the last three years have you ever been unable to work due to migraine or headaches?
wavs/02873.wav|Yeah! We promise! We'll be good! You can come in, but your filter tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
wavs/05505.wav|It also increased the cost to the plaintiff.
wavs/00149.wav|How many episodes of cystitis have you suffered in the last year?
wavs/06297.wav|How did you first come to have any knowledge of it?
wavs/05559.wav|Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on. No more missiles came.
wavs/04425.wav|Anyway, I am going to be a sport.
wavs/00105.wav|With which radioactive substances do you work?
wavs/01012.wav|if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
wavs/05271.wav|They nodded to each OTHER, but did not shake hands.
wavs/02537.wav|You know what I love? She looks so small.
wavs/01541.wav|You finally get up the courage to do it.
wavs/00753.wav|No I'm still married. So how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me
wavs/02388.wav|Has your doctor advised a further surgery?
wavs/05107.wav|Who shall tell what may be the effect of writing?
wavs/06592.wav|For the first time he showed some signs of uneasiness. I'm a beggar.
wavs/05013.wav|She is upstairs. The sorrel saw the horses ahead and wanted to run.
wavs/01876.wav|Please specify the activities planned
wavs/00464.wav|What happened? I don't know. I mean.
wavs/03288.wav|What'd you think? I didn't know you could dance! You were in a play!
wavs/06284.wav|The problem of the ordinary helper is not so difficult.
wavs/00340.wav|Do you do your job in other countries as well? Or may this happen in the future?
wavs/01039.wav|No of course not. It's not even an issue
wavs/05840.wav|It is past two, and we are to dine at five.
wavs/03534.wav|It is this: it is want of warmth.
wavs/02945.wav|That's not what I was saying.
wavs/02133.wav|I'd like that.
wavs/02938.wav|Do you use explosives when diving?
wavs/06475.wav|And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?
wavs/03905.wav|What tortured them was that the past, which they had believed to be "a beautiful poem," now seemed to them a hideous nightmare.
wavs/02836.wav|It's the next day. How needy do I wanna seem? I'm right. Right?
wavs/01162.wav|How often did you attempt suicide?
wavs/03434.wav|Fouche does, too; who knows? WHAT was he?
wavs/01154.wav|That ought to do it.
wavs/05342.wav|And where was the place? You know which I chose. Are masters to their females, and their lords: Then let your will attend on their accords.
wavs/03448.wav|Oh, take care of the dog, my dear colonel!
wavs/01244.wav|What? What? What?
wavs/05300.wav|These can only be judged of by general principles and maxims.
wavs/04085.wav|Upon this Miss King and Margaret were placed.
wavs/05074.wav|If it succeeded they could tell her what it was, for a surprise.
wavs/01379.wav|I can go on pretending Okay!
wavs/04909.wav|That daughter, I gather, is no longer living!
wavs/01689.wav|Try to think of nice calm things. I'm all better now.
wavs/01657.wav|Do you climb as an amateur or professional?
wavs/02875.wav|Did you have any diagnostic finding?
wavs/04563.wav|Suddenly, in that light, the adventure becomes pitifully unimportant.
wavs/00916.wav|Hi.
wavs/00113.wav|I had trouble with it at first. But I get the good stuff.
wavs/05325.wav|It was exactly so. Almost anything will do.
wavs/02488.wav|What symptoms do you suffer from?
wavs/01101.wav|But I don't want to be single, okay?
wavs/02587.wav|I wasn't around that much.
wavs/06415.wav|Do you not FEEL air and space purified?
wavs/04857.wav|He got wet going home, and that night he was a dying child.
wavs/00543.wav|I was just thinking
wavs/03828.wav|And Graham Spencer. Anyway, they fought in Turkey; which I may well believe.
wavs/01886.wav|More or less. Suddenly, we realized we were in Yemen.
wavs/04027.wav|Nothing gives a critic such an air as an apparent familiarity with foreign literature.
wavs/02263.wav|So you know it's either her or me.
wavs/00027.wav|Hi!
wavs/04745.wav|A mild one. Seek not to know more.
wavs/00343.wav|I know I know. When he proposed to me, everyone said, Don't do it.
wavs/04772.wav|Yes, it was awful, but it was so.
wavs/04829.wav|He rose suddenly; he was gradually coming to himself.
wavs/05700.wav|If you'll come you shan't be a loser.
wavs/05467.wav|That is to say, we heard them when they spoke in their loudest tones.
wavs/05353.wav|Why were they not abed like all decent folk?
wavs/06032.wav|Not a sound inside, not a sign of life. A GREAT opportunity lost.
wavs/03164.wav|It's just that. There's something about
wavs/03474.wav|Billy threw an admiring, appreciative glance at her.
wavs/00954.wav|I'll be right back. I hit her in the eye! In the eye!
wavs/05564.wav|And so this interesting place is WHERE you work?
wavs/03854.wav|I here present her to your majesty. The stranger bowed his head; but thanked and declined.
wavs/04574.wav|And I am so miserable!
wavs/01461.wav|Listen. I don't know if you tried to call me because, idiot that I am
wavs/01831.wav|He's a good person
wavs/01625.wav|Come in!
wavs/00313.wav|Are you free of symptoms from the disorder?
wavs/04612.wav|Surely the man had a charmed life. There was a short deep pause.
wavs/06761.wav|On each floor are two ROOMS, let as separate flats.
wavs/06690.wav|He is a devoted friend.
wavs/03344.wav|The GODS preserve you both!
wavs/02061.wav|When did your hospital admission start?
wavs/01927.wav|I'm out of here! Wait! You like him. I want her. He likes you.
wavs/01644.wav|Oh, my God. I know. I'm such an idiot.
wavs/05218.wav|All things went wrong with me. The Philosopher drew back abashed.
wavs/04854.wav|You shall hear all about it after dinner.
wavs/01735.wav|What complaints or Symptoms are caused by this disorder?
wavs/04092.wav|Do you long for the conversation of the wise?
wavs/04365.wav|Impossible to judge until we see how you escape the first.
wavs/06774.wav|But I thought it would be better to promise.
wavs/01857.wav|When were your last symptoms and last use of any treatment?
wavs/05282.wav|Maria went on about the flat from room to room.
wavs/03452.wav|Before him the flames suddenly leaped six feet or more into the air.
wavs/00203.wav|Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
wavs/03795.wav|Yet you have farther gone!
wavs/05913.wav|Tom shouted, and tossed the bundle from him.
wavs/02878.wav|Oh my God! We were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, and it's true!
wavs/01459.wav|Did she mention me? You got a second? Sure, sure.
wavs/02791.wav|Period of benefit payment
wavs/00867.wav|Butt guy what are you doing?
wavs/05975.wav|Bless my postage stamps, Tom!
wavs/05346.wav|Israel's name became a curse and a reproach throughout Barbary.
wavs/02955.wav|Good night.
wavs/03792.wav|He was just the KIND of man to make friends.
wavs/04223.wav|The snow had redoubled in violence, and FILLED the air.
wavs/00315.wav|When was your last seizure or event?
wavs/00444.wav|Wait isn't it almost pure
wavs/01887.wav|Bye.
wavs/04477.wav|Of the SEVEN angels with the seven vials.
wavs/03963.wav|The messengers of Venice stay the meat: Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
wavs/02089.wav|So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
wavs/01702.wav|That's definitely a valid question, and the answer
wavs/04001.wav|You feel as if you'd done them yourself.
wavs/01112.wav|and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable. Tell me why you did this again?
wavs/01850.wav|What was with the dishes?
wavs/06290.wav|It had cost Mrs. Bird a good deal to put it in order.
wavs/04299.wav|Three families occupied that room when I photographed it.
wavs/04153.wav|But she said no more, and continued her saunter till she was tired.
wavs/05286.wav|We cannot solve one part of it without a consideration of the entirety.
wavs/01672.wav|How often do your symptoms occur overall?
wavs/04718.wav|As he was coming from this churchyard side.
wavs/03171.wav|You what? What? There you go.
wavs/00410.wav|Have you required any treatment in hospital or in a rehabilitation hospital?
wavs/06432.wav|She clung to him. And if there is, where did they come from?
wavs/02057.wav|Any other symptom that you may see a health professional about for the first time in next four weeks?
wavs/04397.wav|"Well," said the Colonel, "there ain't a prettier lot on the Back Bay than mine."
wavs/00109.wav|Let's not have that happen again. She could be you.
wavs/01801.wav|Rock hard place
wavs/04291.wav|The world is big enough for us both.
wavs/04824.wav|But some punishment, I want to tell you, some punishment.
wavs/02731.wav|For which aircrafts do you hold a licence?
wavs/00231.wav|So we're just waiting for?
wavs/02106.wav|he's a good person, and he can be really sweet.
wavs/06540.wav|"Oui," answer one and all: "We swear it!"
wavs/03091.wav|Have you undergone surgery once or several times?
wavs/01233.wav|Okay here we go.
wavs/03067.wav|How often do you do races per year?
wavs/03927.wav|There was a water bowl for washing in the morning.
wavs/04384.wav|Where should this music be? I am delighted to have made your acquaintance.
wavs/06797.wav|It takes everything. Well, there you are mistaken!
wavs/01768.wav|Then can we meet him? Sorry.
wavs/01699.wav|and no responsibility. No of course not.
wavs/02390.wav|you'll remember for the rest of your life.
wavs/00739.wav|Know what I like most about him? What? The way he makes me feel about myself.
wavs/02919.wav|Please specify your symptoms or complications
wavs/05025.wav|Her discarded garments were left on the floor.
wavs/02036.wav|Fasten your seat belts
wavs/04206.wav|My unfortunate child, see what you HAVE done!
wavs/00951.wav|Go! Go! Hi Janice.
wavs/03866.wav|But I went away worried.
wavs/05130.wav|I want to confessing. You can't understand, Buck.
wavs/03291.wav|She sounded weird. I gotta call Barry.
wavs/00540.wav|Since then? I wanted to give you a nice memory
wavs/05247.wav|I hear him near. Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much: my name is Brook. Brown, you rascal!
wavs/06049.wav|A large amount of supplies was found in both forts.
wavs/06265.wav|Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.
wavs/01282.wav|But I'm not.
wavs/01802.wav|What was the treatment?
wavs/02946.wav|Well forget.
wavs/01032.wav|and three more cabs show up.
wavs/06406.wav|Shall the shadow disclose itself?
wavs/05959.wav|Would you come with me as far as the railway station and back?
wavs/01555.wav|I just can't do it.
wavs/02693.wav|No. Now, this may hurt. Me?
wavs/00828.wav|More clothes in the dryer? I'm fine. I'm fine. Are you sure?
wavs/02713.wav|can also be used as a phone.
wavs/01185.wav|Oh, boy! All right. Good night, everybody. Good night.
wavs/06339.wav|My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve.
wavs/02893.wav|For future reference, that thing in your hand
wavs/05620.wav|It appears further, he understood Geography; and could read English. Adieu, most honored lords.
wavs/06206.wav|She raised her hands, and pressed her fingers against her temples.
wavs/01141.wav|When you're holding it you feel right. You feel complete.
wavs/04304.wav|He found the porch on which the front door opened.
wavs/04051.wav|What instructions?
wavs/02471.wav|Okay thank you
wavs/06419.wav|I am fearful; wherefore frowns he thus? The world was promised to Abraham because he believed.
wavs/03842.wav|What is it to you WHAT becomes of me?
wavs/01407.wav|This is how you greet guests?
wavs/00371.wav|that funnily enough
wavs/02715.wav|I'm out of here! Wait! He likes you.
wavs/03143.wav|When did you last suffer from headaches?
wavs/05373.wav|There is the remedy for all that you suffer!
wavs/02584.wav|With the holidays coming up. I wanted him to meet my family.
wavs/02923.wav|Come on you guys. This is a big break for me! You're right. It is.
wavs/03090.wav|Do you suffer from any altered feeling of consciousness?
wavs/06804.wav|There was no possibility of rest. Who brought you Living Whales from Labrador?
wavs/01056.wav|Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm? And while we're on the subject of news.
wavs/02823.wav|but at least check in. There you are!
wavs/04917.wav|And rightfully Men call it the Lost Town!
wavs/00627.wav|You're not? That's why you're so great.
wavs/06585.wav|Ladies talking?
wavs/04090.wav|William suffered her to conduct him across the yard.
wavs/00840.wav|You never know. How's the family?
wavs/00128.wav|I'm just cleaning up. Oh, you need any help? Okay sure. Thanks.
wavs/04433.wav|Amanda, what is the matter; don't you feel well?
wavs/03593.wav|O how beautiful! Yet they don't appear to achieve it.
wavs/00104.wav|it's worth it okay?
wavs/06278.wav|For a long time neither of the two conspiring grandmothers dared divulge the secret.
wavs/02438.wav|No I'm still married. So, how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me
wavs/01782.wav|Well, yeah. I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now.
wavs/06474.wav|He pressed his ear closer to her breast.
wavs/02594.wav|Really? He does? Oh she told you about that
wavs/05370.wav|For to bear false witness is nothing else than a work of the tongue.
wavs/03947.wav|The DINNER resembled his breakfast.
wavs/02984.wav|which all future boyfriends will be measured.
wavs/02296.wav|A cool number and a possible name for the kid. See you later.
wavs/05204.wav|Kiss it! On the right bank of the Sacramento.
wavs/06084.wav|And he remembered how white and still it had once looked in the starlight.
wavs/05597.wav|He was GOTTEN in drink.
wavs/02355.wav|We're looking into it.
wavs/06401.wav|I never saw him again, and do not know if he is dead or alive. A secret league, called the "Great Society" linked the centers of intrigue.
wavs/01929.wav|Remember, they're just food, they're not love. I hate that guy!
wavs/05745.wav|Soldiers, adventurers, physicians, apprentices, prostitutes, and cooks were all distinguishable by their appearances.
wavs/02924.wav|When did you first suffer with symptoms?
wavs/02172.wav|An agency left its card. They wanna sign me!
wavs/05869.wav|There was no soothing him.
wavs/05041.wav|In several other places the soldiers used the same brand of horse sense.
wavs/04000.wav|Too late their eyes are opened; they were taken unawares and desire to part company.
wavs/06705.wav|The strictest economy was indispensable.
wavs/02267.wav|How well you know me. How did you pay? Credit card.
wavs/04042.wav|And so we lived year after year. What can be the meaning of this?
wavs/01161.wav|What's the matter?
wavs/06181.wav|Charles was at last able to express his feelings.
wavs/04044.wav|I muse you make so SLIGHT a question.
wavs/02026.wav|Are you planning any activities for the next twelve months?
wavs/02194.wav|Have you ever had any of the following complications?
wavs/03667.wav|He does not know everything but he is not far off the truth.
wavs/03577.wav|Next day the Baron was gone. An officer!
wavs/03535.wav|The past!
wavs/00572.wav|Hey Lowell. Oh hey
wavs/06110.wav|That ever yet this land was guilty of.
wavs/03914.wav|But in any case, I had to return it.
wavs/04061.wav|The boy CAUTIOUSLY let down the window a little way.
wavs/02944.wav|Smell familiar? Oh I'm so sorry.
wavs/03417.wav|The joke's on Barbara, anyway! Hear me with patience.
wavs/05210.wav|I cared nothing for the wetting, but I obeyed him without knowing why.
wavs/00524.wav|It's me. I just
wavs/06482.wav|If this was a trap it was a most skillfully set one. Here, Jean!
wavs/02193.wav|Help! They're still extinct! It's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am.
wavs/04450.wav|That man will ever reach such a state is more than we can say.
wavs/05955.wav|He was DEEPLY in earnest.
wavs/04697.wav|He strolled outside and wandered amongst the flower beds. The worst had come.
wavs/06005.wav|If that isn't a proof of their complicity, I'd like to know what is.
wavs/03904.wav|Mill cites a case of a wounded Frenchman.
wavs/04014.wav|I protest.
wavs/04396.wav|And have you got it? Why should we?
wavs/03001.wav|What other causes are you aware of?
wavs/02619.wav|were.
wavs/04741.wav|Oh, undoubtedly.
wavs/06461.wav|An instance, now. Your mother is very late.
wavs/04476.wav|Well, Ned, I've been thinking it over, but I can't decide right away.
wavs/04117.wav|He was a bold wretch. Will you along? I'll bring lanterns.
wavs/03760.wav|He had become bankrupt, and was not to be found.
wavs/01499.wav|Look at it this way. You dumped her!
wavs/02396.wav|He doesn't have to spend the whole evening with me
wavs/03977.wav|The vehicle dries whatever colours may be used with it, in twelve hours.
wavs/02585.wav|What caused your disorder?
wavs/06268.wav|If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

wavs/04825.wav|One hears very sensible things said on opposite sides.
wavs/00425.wav|What was the reason for the examination?
wavs/01630.wav|Boy if you could
wavs/02459.wav|You know our phone's not working?
wavs/03620.wav|My heart pounded. Possibly four if we do.
wavs/04631.wav|This is startlingly the reverse of the truth.
wavs/00495.wav|When I went there on what would've been our honeymoon
wavs/00400.wav|It's true. Who am I? Oh my God!
wavs/00256.wav|You're gonna be an aunt. Oh, shut up.
wavs/06790.wav|So he read, rather coldly at first, but soon warming.
wavs/00919.wav|Those were the days. What are you gonna do? I have no idea.
wavs/00220.wav|We're some kind of magnets.
wavs/06145.wav|I am foolish enough to feel a little lonely sometimes.
wavs/04959.wav|And where do you suppose I'd put them?
wavs/05133.wav|But it was different in those days of beginnings.
wavs/02844.wav|What is the cause of your joint symptoms?
wavs/01024.wav|Only I know I'm not gonna get there in time. So I am running and I'm running
wavs/02083.wav|No I couldn't do that. Then yeah
wavs/04671.wav|The season had BEEN one of unbroken pleasure and profit.
wavs/02495.wav|When was your last asthma attack?
wavs/03545.wav|What is the explanation of this singular phenomenon?
wavs/06044.wav|Hear nothing from him. So he thought, and he was not mistaken; Mme.
wavs/05837.wav|I will keep his letters to my dying day!
wavs/02391.wav|You look great. Yeah, well.
wavs/03946.wav|The less my family is seen, the better my position.
wavs/05273.wav|Christopher rose. My mistress does not agree with her.
wavs/01412.wav|How do you do that? It's like a gift.
wavs/03606.wav|Do you know of any?
wavs/03885.wav|Dry your eyes, my dear, and give me a kiss.
wavs/02425.wav|There was a cave in in a mine, and eight people were killed. And it was totally
wavs/03487.wav|His next CONCERN was to provide laws for the better government of the colony.
wavs/06176.wav|It is THERE he was born, it is there he means to die!
wavs/00093.wav|Are you a diver on a oil rig?
wavs/02592.wav|Sure we should.
wavs/02094.wav|In the last five years has the condition spread to other parts of your body?
wavs/01389.wav|I can't do it.
wavs/02552.wav|There's something about
wavs/00607.wav|What is your pursuit?
wavs/01494.wav|This is a date. You're going on a date. What are you saying?
wavs/01825.wav|This is every guy's fantasy! That's not true! Ross, is this your fantasy? No, of course not.
wavs/05094.wav|Once more the Lucifer swept over the burning building.
wavs/04865.wav|Take the conduct of the Indians themselves as the proof.
wavs/00295.wav|Yeah, toast, oatmeal. Nothing that spatters. What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
wavs/01817.wav|Oh that sucks.
wavs/05764.wav|"Ten minutes," said David, "is given me in which to do what I would devote years to achieve." Bad as any Kaiser.
wavs/01082.wav|Right. Give it to me.
wavs/03007.wav|It's the best thing to happen to you!
wavs/04835.wav|If I lose you I'm crippled for life.
wavs/06399.wav|He mentions also that the island is mountainous.
wavs/05972.wav|This castle hath a pleasant seat: the air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses.
wavs/01793.wav|I'm talking about the whole baby thing. Did you ever get this sort of
wavs/00780.wav|Some greeting cards.
wavs/00353.wav|Hello Joey
wavs/03594.wav|By day, the fierce heat pressed its intolerable burden on the quivering air.
wavs/02859.wav|Hi Dad. No no. It's me.
wavs/01146.wav|Thank you. That's not really the point. The point is, that
wavs/02464.wav|This is stupid!
wavs/04346.wav|Refusal of dinner to Douglass on the Potomac steamer.
wavs/00115.wav|You're so funny!
wavs/06463.wav|It's quite impressive to hear him talk. But THERE'S one satisfaction.
wavs/05550.wav|A foe, at least to you, I trust never justly to be esteemed.
wavs/06813.wav|Lack of courage destroys your confidence in yourself.
wavs/02373.wav|Know what blows my mind? You look down, and there they are.
wavs/03248.wav|it's important enough for everyone else. That guy's going home with a note.
wavs/01409.wav|in that they don't. They don't?
wavs/04024.wav|To be sure, Socrates; and Homer was my master.
wavs/04519.wav|A Digest of International Law.
wavs/02936.wav|When was the business established?
wavs/01055.wav|It's a cold drink. It's a hot day.
wavs/03829.wav|I may, and will, if she be so contented.
wavs/02048.wav|Do you take part in fights or competitions?
wavs/04839.wav|The glory of the Indian summer was close at hand.
wavs/04366.wav|Marcus sprang forward to help him with his overcoat.
wavs/04791.wav|I haven't an ounce of chemical left on board.
wavs/05689.wav|I did more than that.
wavs/06171.wav|For there is no impassable gulf between the two.
wavs/04927.wav|For which use, indeed, it now chiefly serves.
wavs/06726.wav|His GUIDE nodded, and withdrew.
wavs/02120.wav|Great!
wavs/01113.wav|Since when have you been symptom free?
wavs/03397.wav|Let us confess, and turn it to a jest.
wavs/06392.wav|And if you do not know, you are not knowing. Oh, chase me, girls!
wavs/03361.wav|We have one enemy the less. Would it turn over?
wavs/04163.wav|Sir Walter WORE an eyeglass.
wavs/04176.wav|Sometimes, however, a bitter remorse seized him. But in both cases they fail.
wavs/01210.wav|I can't tell you how excited I am to be here.
wavs/02616.wav|It was just so nice to see him again, you know?
wavs/00358.wav|Oh, that's nice! Okay, okay, okay, I got one!
wavs/02672.wav|Excuse me. Here we go.
wavs/04141.wav|What is the vice contrary to this virtue?
wavs/04685.wav|But please don't STAY, ma'am.
wavs/04575.wav|It was nothing, nothing at all. He was a member of a rifle team.
wavs/00351.wav|You're not doing it for me. Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
wavs/02911.wav|The One Where It All Began (Pilot)
wavs/05910.wav|He don't tumble to the racket, that he don't!
wavs/00949.wav|I even do my own laundry.
wavs/01448.wav|I'm sorry. Is that your basket?
wavs/05768.wav|Josephine.
wavs/01901.wav|Benefit type
wavs/05799.wav|He had found the man!
wavs/02269.wav|Now I have to go down there and deal with them
wavs/04867.wav|Ryan rapidly ascended the upper ladders and returned to the light of day.
wavs/02586.wav|What? I know.
wavs/00323.wav|Do you suffer from allergies that affect your breathing? for example hay fever
wavs/05384.wav|The sun of their system a father of flies!
wavs/05686.wav|Prove it me now, and I will believe you.
wavs/04035.wav|How is it that I live after hearing it?
wavs/02406.wav|He's open! He's open! Shoot it! Shoot it!
wavs/05966.wav|Voices were heard at the end of the corridor.
wavs/05050.wav|Oh, pardon me, Hetty; I certainly did not begin to quarrel about her.
wavs/04655.wav|Then I will begin again, and ask: If one is not, what are the consequences?
wavs/00395.wav|Have you completed all the therapy sessions?
wavs/00107.wav|There's a bunch of stuff we could've done tonight. Okay I got one.
wavs/04810.wav|An angel!
wavs/06340.wav|Young man, your manners need mending. He's asleep in the library.
wavs/03364.wav|The man continued his flight to Paris. What an amalgamation!
wavs/04604.wav|Not so, if he SIMPLY has been in jail.
wavs/05984.wav|But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon.
wavs/06034.wav|Then another silence, till she was seized with another uncontrollable fit of grief.
wavs/00499.wav|You won't even look at him.
wavs/00384.wav|Do you still have symptoms, colic or haematuria?
wavs/02116.wav|When did you undergo surgery?
wavs/05743.wav|Will he think I look better in that?
wavs/00002.wav|Okay so this time I won't quit! All right! I'm putting it out I'm putting it out.
wavs/01091.wav|Would anybody like more coffee? You made it, or you're serving it?
wavs/00488.wav|How's that possible? It's always on the news.
wavs/02294.wav|died about two hours ago. But I couldn't get a flight out till tomorrow, so here I am.
wavs/00821.wav|You should just do it. Just throw me. Now? Yeah, right now. Just.
wavs/03571.wav|He would have passed farther, but the doors were secured without. Yes, May.
wavs/04182.wav|Their clothes, largely made from the skins of animals, are warm.
wavs/00685.wav|I thought you were on my side
wavs/04465.wav|I have said farewell already.
wavs/03712.wav|She stood quite still. WELCOME to our lofty land!
wavs/04654.wav|Hopkins gave her a nice, red rose and walked upstairs.
wavs/01337.wav|Did you have further treatment radiation or chemo therapy)?
wavs/06796.wav|Disastrous absence of help! You see, they play. And it isn't fair: I would say it though it were with my last breath; it isn't fair.
wavs/03781.wav|The frank brutality of the answer had not offended her.
wavs/04040.wav|Life is hard. The roof has fallen in!
wavs/05904.wav|This again may be best illustrated by a figure of speech.
wavs/03642.wav|Excellent salad!
wavs/05834.wav|My papers and my clothes disappeared at the same time.
wavs/02755.wav|Surprise!
wavs/06515.wav|I protested.
wavs/05323.wav|Freda!
wavs/01223.wav|Specify your 'other' hazardous duties
wavs/03556.wav|I was against that from the first and I came to tell you so.
wavs/06120.wav|But be not you called Rabbi. Our guest for the night.
wavs/03272.wav|That's sweet. Could I take her?
wavs/03532.wav|I mean they could have done nothing to save the passengers and themselves.
wavs/06349.wav|My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
wavs/06776.wav|If the Earl can but come through, he will match with Leicester yet.
wavs/00965.wav|a quality. A quality. Great. What? He's cute.
wavs/05762.wav|Tired.
wavs/01352.wav|I can't believe it. This sucks.
wavs/02723.wav|What future boyfriends?
wavs/01248.wav|Thank you. They're yours.
wavs/06393.wav|What a look! It is Max! If so it is, arise in haste!
wavs/06195.wav|He's crazy about you, and when I think of you in that house!
wavs/02572.wav|Okay. Rock hard place. Me.
wavs/01193.wav|would you tell her?
wavs/02834.wav|We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who. I'll know. This is so not what I needed right now.
wavs/06063.wav|Conscience.
wavs/05023.wav|A servant girl, sleeping in the next room, heard nothing.
wavs/03857.wav|He decided he would have another drink of whiskey.
wavs/02510.wav|Briefly describe your daily duties
wavs/02067.wav|What was the other cause of this condition?
wavs/02001.wav|I don't know why you're embarrassed. They were very nice boobies.
wavs/05698.wav|He elected to answer the challenge of that glance.
wavs/00137.wav|Do you still have gestational diabetes?
wavs/05206.wav|Roberts Brothers.
wavs/04493.wav|Suppose I were to meddle in the affairs of the chateau?
wavs/04819.wav|I was to blame myself.
wavs/02629.wav|Please be good. Please?
wavs/00073.wav|Do you currently suffer any s complications?
wavs/02979.wav|I'm not afraid.
wavs/05249.wav|Human nature won't stand it.
wavs/03543.wav|Yes, he had come down in the scale so low as to STRIKE her.
wavs/03793.wav|Yes; and here is the key to it.
wavs/01855.wav|Let me talk to you for just a sec.
wavs/04632.wav|It's what my wife could read between the lines.
wavs/01935.wav|How many episodes did you have in the last five years?
wavs/00716.wav|Which I'm not. Well, it does not ring a bell with me.
wavs/00544.wav|Don't do that. Come on!
wavs/01525.wav|Do currently suffer any joint restrictions?
wavs/00684.wav|How many flying hours do you plan in the next two months?
wavs/05145.wav|Well?
wavs/03575.wav|No; it is not possible. How could such a thought occur to you?
wavs/02108.wav|Right in front of the Statue of Liberty.
wavs/05004.wav|Fresh oysters have come in.
wavs/06208.wav|I am not so scared as I was, my boy.
wavs/06142.wav|Moreover, I have spoken; nor do I change my word because he threatens me.
wavs/03484.wav|The buffalo therefore had seen none of his antagonists.
wavs/04104.wav|I flashed my gaze FROM her to him.
wavs/01008.wav|Do you regularly visit your doctor regarding this condition?
wavs/04332.wav|Any children?
wavs/03896.wav|Pollyanna nodded.
wavs/01487.wav|You were right. You!
wavs/04335.wav|There are papers published to warn Americans against the plotting of this political Church.
wavs/06758.wav|I suppose age comes on one so gradually that it is seldom observed.
wavs/02643.wav|just to see if I was okay? I mean, how needy is that?
wavs/01298.wav|When did you last have symptoms with your skin?
wavs/03565.wav|We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits. The doctrine of "intercession" illustrated.
wavs/00582.wav|The hair comes out and the gloves come on.
wavs/03515.wav|I had told him of his son's renown.
wavs/02816.wav|Which side of body was involved?
wavs/01038.wav|Are you controlled for radiation impacts?
wavs/00537.wav|you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.
wavs/04542.wav|We entered.
wavs/04859.wav|Special services? O hunting and fishing is ever her play!
wavs/05782.wav|He therefore changes the tone of his voice and speaks kindly to them.
wavs/02506.wav|That wasn't easy but you did it. I believe when the right woman comes along
wavs/01052.wav|as our gift.  Do you believe it?
wavs/03783.wav|Voyage to South America, Eng.
wavs/00382.wav|I'm sorry, so we is? Oh, so you're divorced? No.
wavs/01787.wav|when did you start to feel like a father?
wavs/02279.wav|If it's important enough while I'm playing
wavs/06000.wav|The cotton gin had just begun its revolutionary work.
wavs/04226.wav|Sir William, how can you tell such a story?
wavs/01172.wav|You don't have to worry about me. I'm doing fine. I'm afraid this has been denied.
wavs/05217.wav|He watched it the next night and the next.
wavs/03002.wav|I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that. No it wasn't!
wavs/02901.wav|Why, all of the sudden, are you so? What?
wavs/00758.wav|And now I know.
wavs/06127.wav|The place of the Dialogue in the series is doubtful.
wavs/00014.wav|It's because we Sorry sorry. I can't believe
wavs/00595.wav|You're so much cuter than your pictures.
wavs/01510.wav|Wait I may have something in the back. Oh my God.
wavs/02480.wav|Which side of the body is affected?
wavs/01450.wav|Come on, she's a person. You can do it. Could she be more out of my league? Back me up.
wavs/03852.wav|You love Nell as heartily as she deserves.
wavs/03294.wav|They wanna know if I'm okay? Okay, let's see.
wavs/05132.wav|This was, as you may think, a terrible shock to her.
wavs/04196.wav|Did Anthony wish to APPEAR sublime in his own eyes?
wavs/01799.wav|Do you climb
wavs/03423.wav|Head Resistance.
wavs/00288.wav|Come on show me.
wavs/06165.wav|He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
wavs/05795.wav|It diminished a certain fear that was mingled with her love of him.
wavs/02982.wav|Come on. This is all way too
wavs/06313.wav|Diana persisted. Your good old servant knows where to go.
wavs/04593.wav|Only the sooner the better. But what is the tide?
wavs/01680.wav|How many areas of your body are affected?
wavs/03387.wav|He is a GOOD creature; he would have taken it all on his shoulders.
wavs/01399.wav|You got a second? Sure, sure. Come on
wavs/00977.wav|Tell her. I don't wanna go
wavs/01140.wav|She never took them off.
wavs/05845.wav|"Yea," said Richard, "and she might have praised her in such wise that the words had came forth like gall and vinegar."
wavs/02917.wav|right here, right now, what would you say? If it helps I could slide over.
wavs/02685.wav|you'll have the guts to say, No, thanks, I'm married.
wavs/06374.wav|Everybody was cap in HAND to the famous man!
wavs/04272.wav|The SUBJECT was full of snares for the narrator.
wavs/03273.wav|For how many hours do the headaches usually last?
wavs/03807.wav|It is with regard to him that I desire to speak to you.
wavs/03240.wav|Please state the gross profit over the last three years
wavs/01417.wav|So.
wavs/02840.wav|Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.
wavs/03956.wav|But at all events she hath the complaint before her.
wavs/04674.wav|Throw your hat into the air and cry hurrah!
wavs/00462.wav|there isn't anything I can't do.
wavs/05498.wav|Advise yourself. There is HARDLY any change at all.
wavs/04021.wav|Farewell, or fare ill, as it may happen!
wavs/01650.wav|There. That looks okay, right? You went a bit wide on the lipstick.
wavs/03707.wav|She extinguished the taper, and handed him the pen again.
wavs/04770.wav|But this I can say: to call any act evil, instantly begs the question. The truth of it went home to her.
wavs/01875.wav|Didn't you get a good enough look? We're all adults here. There's only one way to resolve this.
wavs/02182.wav|How often do you take medication?
wavs/06307.wav|I am very sorry, Rosamond; I know this is painful.
wavs/00406.wav|and complaining about them to you. 
wavs/05349.wav|Lucien sat down and made no reply. I do nothing.
wavs/01483.wav|Yes bunny? Peach pit. That night we had
wavs/03817.wav|"An actor," he says, "must know all the passions, so that he may express them as he should."
wavs/03466.wav|I admit all your good qualities, Clay. And mine shall.
wavs/00097.wav|I'm sorry. I can't believe I did this.
wavs/02500.wav|It looks like a fun gang. Let me see!
wavs/02160.wav|What are you talking about? I know he's not perfect.
wavs/03053.wav|And a smile so bewitching
wavs/06358.wav|Their ways are always before him, they are not hidden from his eyes.
wavs/04946.wav|It was a notable performance. Have they no money?
wavs/05058.wav|"My friends," SAID Curtis, "we must make a fire; it is our last and only chance." See here!
wavs/02082.wav|No. Last time I left a spontaneous message
wavs/05415.wav|Would you not think it breathed? Back your opinion.
wavs/04922.wav|Love and hate are only the positive and negative aspects of the same relation.
wavs/01739.wav|What? Peach pit.
wavs/04826.wav|But sure you must know. Error. He did not comprehend.
wavs/01071.wav|Would you stop humping me for two seconds?
wavs/02096.wav|Oh yeah! Right!
wavs/03337.wav|Of the part of England.
wavs/06395.wav|Delay: yes or no? And I wish, for your sake, the thing had not happened.
wavs/04400.wav|I have lived among vile people; and I am vile like them. They always "muddle through", they tell you; that is the motto of their ruling caste.
wavs/04524.wav|It is true, General, that we have found nothing.
wavs/03881.wav|The time passed slowly. To earth the mourners turn.
wavs/05157.wav|This was no time to risk such a disappointment.
wavs/01484.wav|Do your legs have one or more of the following symptoms
wavs/05205.wav|The opposition express GREAT love for white blood.
wavs/05185.wav|She did act real fond of Lily, and she pined away considerable, too.
wavs/02669.wav|I gotta go. I'll miss the last train.
wavs/03510.wav|The deeper they were, the more they enlarged the wound.
wavs/06283.wav|We must go down to the Corral now.
wavs/05259.wav|He started yelling then and became very defensive.
wavs/01134.wav|He happened to call.
wavs/00285.wav|But the truth is at the end of the day, I still really wanna be
wavs/00980.wav|How often per year do your activities include underwater explosions?
wavs/02752.wav|I mean, with the holidays coming up I wanted him to meet my family
wavs/05231.wav|I will now hear: what say you of this gentlewoman?
wavs/06730.wav|The bishop!
wavs/03980.wav|His nurse! Presently he stood at the altar, and called them to him.
wavs/04325.wav|The old man hated him, and never would bank with him.
wavs/01647.wav|Are you being treated by a physician?
wavs/00591.wav|What'd you think?
wavs/02847.wav|The ball is dropping!
wavs/05123.wav|Knowing his constitution, I decided on waiting a day or two.
wavs/04130.wav|Of course his debts had to be paid.
wavs/05579.wav|When he returns! Now we were close together.
wavs/01849.wav|Don't you respect your body?
wavs/00824.wav|How many episodes of digestive symptoms have you had in the last two years?
wavs/03888.wav|These are undoubtedly lines of fissure, caused by the subterranean forces.
wavs/01342.wav|and I realize I'm totally naked. I've had that dream.
wavs/01659.wav|Since when have you been free of symptoms from your hip disorder?
wavs/00441.wav|Look look
wavs/02324.wav|You okay? Really?
wavs/06260.wav|A fall indeed from his original conception of his name of fame abroad!
wavs/04979.wav|I had often seen him in love before.
wavs/02622.wav|What four of us?
wavs/05897.wav|You know him well enough to grant me that.
wavs/05400.wav|What does the Colonel think?
wavs/02965.wav|Which specific allergic complaints exist or have been existing during the last five years?
wavs/03948.wav|He had large powers for the regulation of trade. Weeping like a coward!
wavs/04121.wav|The controversy involved the preservation of pure doctrine.
wavs/02564.wav|So, what do you want? You.
wavs/05804.wav|Like most provincial artisans, he WORKED in a small basement shop.
wavs/00984.wav|I've got to get to work.
wavs/00557.wav|It has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean.
wavs/03616.wav|O legislator!
wavs/04265.wav|It was not a very heroic situation for us.
wavs/02085.wav|What other symptoms other than headaches occur during your attacks?
wavs/06532.wav|And with bare livelihood Amy would not, could not, be content.
wavs/01749.wav|Well I don't know.
wavs/06062.wav|Then what prevents you from experiencing the same sense of relief that I feel?
wavs/03735.wav|Was heard, and he came wondering to the bed.
wavs/02884.wav|Yeah isn't he? That's nice.
wavs/02830.wav|Wait here okay? Breathe.
wavs/01864.wav|They're going in fine, but they're coming out all
wavs/03662.wav|Shall pay full dearly for this encounter, If once they join in trial.
wavs/04977.wav|Searching after truth, I have become but the minister of falsehoods.
wavs/06634.wav|I was not of his mind. Why, I am unfortunate, too!
wavs/04160.wav|Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I am?
wavs/05405.wav|Where is Green? She says she will grow up eccentric.
wavs/03459.wav|Grand thought! Your letter has been forwarded to me.
wavs/06717.wav|Have you committed? The distinction was too great.
wavs/01977.wav|Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
wavs/03205.wav|There's something you should know.
wavs/05070.wav|Haynes, you are trying to stand too upright.
wavs/06304.wav|The Mitre. On the beds lie scores of dainty boxes.
wavs/05884.wav|Is Faith of no avail?
wavs/00306.wav|They have a liking problem with you
wavs/06484.wav|You can go to Japan, and get pictures of earthquakes.
wavs/02231.wav|See?
wavs/04731.wav|An hour I sat on cliff edge and watched.
wavs/02652.wav|Any diamond ring we find, we'll run it by you. I know I had it this morning.
wavs/02261.wav|And did you notice? Know what was great? The way his smile was crooked.
wavs/06190.wav|And so you will act rightly and well?
wavs/04393.wav|But I think you have had about enough for one day.
wavs/03328.wav|Has the fracture healed without complications and further symptoms?
wavs/05890.wav|Organize, for instance, is the word of the Empire, and sums up Napoleon completely.
wavs/05737.wav|Now I know that my will must be made again, I write instantly.
wavs/05876.wav|Startling as the assertion may be, I believe it to be strictly true.
wavs/03442.wav|And, except that you'll be pretty much in the dark, you'll be quite comfortable.
wavs/05100.wav|The sergeant lowered his bayonet. This visit led to others.
wavs/04724.wav|Never yet had her magnificent eyes looked at him as they looked now.
wavs/03103.wav|I got you What?
wavs/00558.wav|How often did or do you have symptoms?
wavs/01415.wav|You try to run out of the restaurant before she's finished the note.
wavs/03499.wav|What is it, Mr. Damon? What you need is that tonic I prescribed.
wavs/03131.wav|Where am I gonna stay? Here?
wavs/04135.wav|It was the bishop who persuaded them to change their minds.
wavs/04134.wav|The place looked ten years old instead of only two.
wavs/02529.wav|It wasn't that bad. I was the lead. It was better than the troll thing. At least you got to see my head.
wavs/03727.wav|The differences that age makes in hearing are of importance.
wavs/00029.wav|Head rush.
wavs/03618.wav|I couldn't help it, Captain; I wanted to be in on this game.
wavs/05125.wav|You are not going to the public meeting?
wavs/05124.wav|Lapham spoke to the woman again. Never quails!
wavs/05361.wav|Yes; but Miss Morgan is so uninteresting, and not young.
wavs/03820.wav|The girl is worth her WEIGHT in gold to me.
wavs/03412.wav|He openly told her that life was worth nothing to him without me.
wavs/02877.wav|Has any further medical treatment been recommended or carried out?
wavs/01473.wav|Since when have you been free of symptoms from this disorder?
wavs/05507.wav|His gaze rested at length upon Miss Carrington.
wavs/01679.wav|But you tell it really well sweetie.
wavs/05358.wav|Raymond said that his lasted for six days.
wavs/03314.wav|Of course! That's so great!
wavs/05946.wav|Well done, young married volk!
wavs/04564.wav|Find out where she's stopping.
wavs/04766.wav|Astonished, did I hear you say? It has just come.
wavs/01540.wav|Excuse me? Hello! Like he was really gonna send you one.
wavs/05696.wav|"The end of the tankard," quoth he, looking into it, "hath already come." I pretended not to understand.
wavs/06467.wav|Fine weather.
wavs/00944.wav|Please describe your accident including the date
wavs/05027.wav|It served him well right! That's the idea! The queen is the mother.
wavs/04123.wav|Mother told me to take the suit off.
wavs/05404.wav|I was kind of lonesome in the world too.
wavs/02011.wav|One of these times, it's just gonna be your last chance with me!
wavs/06277.wav|That would make me base if you like.
wavs/03984.wav|How do I know that you are a TRUE messenger?
wavs/02501.wav|there's really money in here. I know. Weird Girl what are you doing?
wavs/06534.wav|I guess that COMES of living by the Mediterranean.
wavs/00550.wav|And so well
wavs/06315.wav|Massacres and disorders never pave the way to peace.
wavs/00168.wav|Isn't he great? He's so cute. And he likes you so much.
wavs/00784.wav|He is so great. But that's over.
wavs/01740.wav|You have me. No, no. Just you.
wavs/06103.wav|We have all our failings; you are too hard upon him, you are, faith.
wavs/02993.wav|She answered.
wavs/01853.wav|I have a thing, which means you can't ever do that! What's wrong, sweetie? Nothing.
wavs/02615.wav|Which other mixed gas do you use for diving?
wavs/02524.wav|He should take the sack? Anyway
wavs/05716.wav|Her eyes closed, and her head fell back.
wavs/06326.wav|My good wife, you are getting well, are not you?
wavs/02912.wav|All right then, forget it. Might as well just go home.
wavs/05322.wav|Why did you let me ring three times in such weather? For example.
wavs/02359.wav|She's too much for me in bed. Yeah isn't he?
wavs/05382.wav|No, Wendy.
wavs/00803.wav|Crapping on my heart
wavs/01805.wav|This is the worst breakup in the history of the world!
wavs/06121.wav|That little fellow. The two men separated. I am out again, as you see.
wavs/01646.wav|Are you working with explosives?
wavs/05957.wav|"Exert yourself, dear Marianne," she cried, "if you would not kill yourself and all who love you."
wavs/05881.wav|For that matter Mr. Livingstone wasn't much more than a name to us.
wavs/00176.wav|Okay, then you let me go grocery shopping
wavs/01945.wav|Excuse me
wavs/04381.wav|She was right! And what of the mental habit?
wavs/03281.wav|what I wanted to say was
wavs/00407.wav|Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping
wavs/06083.wav|Tramp! I employed some people to procure me a specimen, but without success.
wavs/00398.wav|Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.
wavs/01856.wav|Uh oh. It's a song.
wavs/01569.wav|his midterms.
wavs/06442.wav|It was really too much of a good thing.
wavs/05615.wav|There's nothing to tell. And so the matter ended.
wavs/00597.wav|That's impossible.
wavs/01003.wav|What?
wavs/05121.wav|They insisted, like Socrates, on a definite meaning to words.
wavs/06590.wav|The surprise, therefore, with which he heard me was just wonderful.
wavs/06170.wav|Then he isn't buried in Manor Park Cemetery?
wavs/03641.wav|The long, lazy summer days have slipped by.
wavs/05746.wav|I wired for my car to meet us.
wavs/02825.wav|But that was the worst breakup in history! I'm not saying it was a good idea. I snapped!
wavs/01117.wav|and none of the responsibility.
wavs/06069.wav|A fresh, wild, primitive land.
wavs/02926.wav|Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
wavs/05717.wav|There is the religious mine, the philosophical mine, the economic mine, the revolutionary mine.
wavs/05630.wav|I don't believe I could land anything after what happened.
wavs/03855.wav|And I will receive you. Very well, then, treat me like your mother.
wavs/06676.wav|I do not like your laws at all.
wavs/00731.wav|everything's kind of pink. Don't be upset. It can happen to anyone.
wavs/02316.wav|Have you fully recovered and no longer use treatment?
wavs/01529.wav|Everybody ready?
wavs/04317.wav|Still the little woman hesitated; then she spoke.
wavs/03598.wav|He answered that the name was new to him.
wavs/00139.wav|I mean, how's this gonna work, you know, with us? When important decisions have to be made?
wavs/01645.wav|Which surgery did you undergo?
wavs/00173.wav|this is it. Just a couple of things I wanted to say.
wavs/02806.wav|right, but instead of Bugs it was first base Alan, second base Alan, third base
wavs/01019.wav|I mean, it it was like, it was like he made us into a team. Can I ask you guys a question?
wavs/05930.wav|The mountain road was dark and narrow and crooked.
wavs/00617.wav|What type of motor car sport do you take part in?
wavs/02864.wav|What are you doing? You scared the crap out of me! Was that the cake? Yeah.
wavs/02734.wav|May we help you? I'm okay! I'm okay!
wavs/02381.wav|Please specify part of body where ruptured joint ligaments occurred
wavs/01425.wav|Oh, my God! What? Were we at the same table? It's like
wavs/04387.wav|She had given the cue to the one who was to speak after her.
wavs/06232.wav|Which nation has the best system of stamp duty?
wavs/06058.wav|My lord.
wavs/04375.wav|Oh, Tom, you couldn't give me a better present. Tigers!
wavs/01143.wav|When was your diabetes diagnosed?
wavs/06750.wav|But he is a mere boy! The symptoms are worse.
wavs/04752.wav|The other Doctor Livingstone is your brother? Why should she not be mine?
wavs/00476.wav|Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
wavs/04607.wav|There were all kinds of uniforms. See Com.
wavs/06168.wav|I don't sympathize with suspicion, from having none myself.
wavs/06191.wav|Ten or a dozen years were thus sung.
wavs/00489.wav|you know, I might have a life. Like I haven't been sitting here
wavs/05071.wav|Principles dwindle and pale in your constitutional cellar.
wavs/02170.wav|I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.
wavs/00087.wav|Oh you don't get it! What do you got there?
wavs/04204.wav|It was TIME to dress.
wavs/00761.wav|Do you suffer from neuralgia, sensory loss or paralysis?
wavs/05508.wav|His eyes, after first meeting mine, traveled downward to my foot.
wavs/00942.wav|I'm lying. I am so drunk. Oh, God. You know what? You could've called.
wavs/02361.wav|Please give details of your occupation and business activities over the last five years
wavs/03566.wav|I can put you on to the track of the thing.
wavs/06258.wav|At dinner, the count subjected me to a TORTURE I had little expected.
wavs/02683.wav|What competition do you take part in?
wavs/00421.wav|What is the maximum heights you go to?
wavs/02856.wav|What other symptoms do you suffer from?
wavs/00710.wav|How did you get over it? Say her Leg?
wavs/05122.wav|We remark, however, that their Circular rather recoiled on themselves.
wavs/01060.wav|Are you engaged as a diving instructor?
wavs/06460.wav|Am I not right, Ion? Sweet lovers love the spring.
wavs/00276.wav|But then everyone will know.
wavs/00459.wav|What examinations have or will be done, and what were the results?
wavs/01769.wav|Now you're gonna be in a wheelchair the rest of your life, pally wally.
wavs/01457.wav|Now, it's just gotta be one of those things where l
wavs/03766.wav|Connecticut and Rhode Island. What power had taught her?
wavs/01250.wav|your problem is quite clear.
wavs/00305.wav|For how long, when and how often have you been unable to work?
wavs/03507.wav|Her face was as though the name meant nothing to her.
wavs/02968.wav|I don't know. We still care about each other.
wavs/00829.wav|If you don't do it I will. You said they'd shoot it without you. I thought they could.
wavs/01454.wav|All right.
wavs/04566.wav|This morning I am worse.
wavs/05933.wav|In a few minutes we were marching through the streets of FREDERICKSBURG. Lord Lytton.
wavs/01610.wav|You do know I was talking about you, right?
wavs/04890.wav|That is the most vicious JADE of all.
wavs/03982.wav|It was my beloved who lay unconscious on the ground.
wavs/05835.wav|His service is a slice.
wavs/05237.wav|According to my calculation we must have been very near Suez.
wavs/01269.wav|More wine? Oh I think so.
wavs/02477.wav|You hate sticking your finger in your eye. Not for her.
wavs/02077.wav|He's a big boy. He'll get over it. No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
wavs/06423.wav|My good wife, you are getting well, are not you? Can you do this?
wavs/05444.wav|Will you rob me? I have seen no one but you at this table.
wavs/03768.wav|My LIMBS longer refused to support my body.
wavs/04198.wav|The housekeeper staggered back against the wall of the passage.
wavs/03926.wav|Despotism, constraint, destruction sit waving in his plumes.
wavs/06496.wav|She really looked almost wild.
wavs/00457.wav|I still really wanna be
wavs/06772.wav|The handles of the knives, now, were they gold, too?
wavs/04792.wav|My pistols I had left behind in my hurry.
wavs/02665.wav|They think you're a little What? Intense and creepy.
wavs/05707.wav|The training of the actor! The result was always the same. Say, yes!
wavs/00908.wav|I'm gonna miss you, you scientist guy. It gets better every.
wavs/02357.wav|Please indicate the changes
wavs/01620.wav|What? So there's going to be a fifth date?
wavs/04965.wav|For one could not spank them all, you know!
wavs/01504.wav|Do you take part in any form of racing?
wavs/03688.wav|And he would point to his arm. Doth the East glad tidings bring?
wavs/01235.wav|that you and I
wavs/06081.wav|Can't fetch yer back again? What time is your school out?
wavs/02069.wav|A glass is on the table with no coaster. A cold drink. A hot day. Beads of condensation are inching closer to the wood.
wavs/02658.wav|You should call her fairly quickly.
wavs/03672.wav|What for should I be making inquiries about my guests?
wavs/00022.wav|You take your time.
wavs/06729.wav|Oh, Minnie!
wavs/01247.wav|There's been unusual activity on your account.
wavs/02161.wav|Don't say listen.  I know that listen.  I've said that listen. 
wavs/03985.wav|The bailiff steadily met my father on his ground.
wavs/04350.wav|It decided him. How was she to leave it?
wavs/00937.wav|Is she familiar with our special situation? Yes, and she's very supportive. Okay, that's great.
wavs/01776.wav|But I definitely want to be a part of it!
wavs/05929.wav|We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man.
wavs/05681.wav|Her instant detection and exposure, perhaps a disgraceful punishment, would have been inevitable.
wavs/05097.wav|Mass.
wavs/05330.wav|Look at the socialists themselves. Who could possibly sleep in it?
wavs/06645.wav|The mother was only just able to break the violence of her fall.
wavs/00345.wav|Thank you. You don't wanna go in there! Come on, we're roommates.
wavs/04186.wav|Be patient.
wavs/05847.wav|He was eccentric in some ways and would take long journeys on foot.
wavs/02292.wav|This is ridiculous. We are great together! I have no frame of reference, but I thought that was great!
wavs/01780.wav|Oh God! Oh
wavs/02915.wav|How can I dump this woman on Valentine's Day? Hi just Janice.
wavs/03488.wav|Vic sat looking thoughtfully at the man BEFORE him.
wavs/06213.wav|I myself am of this nature. Weigh it.
wavs/04529.wav|To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman, it never will be.
wavs/05753.wav|"Yes," answered Barnum calmly, "but you may take the contracts for halls and printing off my hands at cost."
wavs/06511.wav|The woman detained him with her slow, light fingers.
wavs/05465.wav|And is not running a species of doing?
wavs/01265.wav|What are you doing? We're going to a hospital!
wavs/01572.wav|Have you had any lung function tests?
wavs/00456.wav|If you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. Welcome to the real world!
wavs/03456.wav|Moody pressed her hand significantly as it rested on his arm.
wavs/00153.wav|Is this other activity for pleasure only?
wavs/01347.wav|Which other medications are you taking?
wavs/04692.wav|"Mademoiselle," he said gravely, "once before, long ago, you permitted me to kiss you." They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment.
wavs/05172.wav|I'll kill you, you cur.
wavs/06589.wav|Absolutely nothing.
wavs/04391.wav|Then suddenly, without warning, we pitched over a little rise to the river.
wavs/03561.wav|And finish up by a collision with the sun!
wavs/06123.wav|No one would know it was a watch.
wavs/04555.wav|Was that my father that went hence so fast?
wavs/04827.wav|During the season a kind of fair was daily held near the fountain.
wavs/05293.wav|As to vowels, he scarcely considered them at all.
wavs/03555.wav|I do not think much of him. John Bellew did.
wavs/06655.wav|What a splendid city! The storms are coming.
wavs/00782.wav|What medications are you taking for the osteoporosis?
wavs/06505.wav|Listen to an old man; I am speaking quite seriously.
wavs/04668.wav|It was quite by his WISH that I went there.
wavs/05141.wav|But just about a week later a beautiful thing occurred.
wavs/06180.wav|He has an appointment that I know of for Saturday next.
wavs/05490.wav|Do not let your attention get away from the work you are at.
wavs/03917.wav|Tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye.
wavs/06782.wav|Yes, you are indeed altered! Oh, I want to hug you!
wavs/01744.wav|So on our no date evening, three of you now have dates. And I met this really hot single mom at the store.
wavs/03586.wav|You be ready when I COME at seven.
wavs/00675.wav|And I don't have to. I know. You know?
wavs/00599.wav|This is my friend's machine.
wavs/05148.wav|Certainly not, he said. I didn't mean anything.
wavs/01828.wav|Does the knuckle cracking bother everybody, or just him?
wavs/06128.wav|Lying there, he heard the chase go panting by.
wavs/05989.wav|Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
wavs/06643.wav|You must play over some of these things to me.
wavs/04743.wav|Would she come to see me before I was killed?
wavs/04515.wav|This was also of a less fine quality. Antiochus the Great.
wavs/01451.wav|Okay. I'd just I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
wavs/04554.wav|He could love but once, and in one way only.
wavs/05257.wav|A new identity, which she might own anywhere!
wavs/04820.wav|When people are ill, they have such strange fancies!
wavs/00822.wav|That's pretty much it.
wavs/04610.wav|There were never any empty moments in my day.
wavs/06314.wav|How COULD the smallest comfort here be flowing?
wavs/00278.wav|No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. No, no, I ha I have to give you something.
wavs/01931.wav|You guys I am not that bad!
wavs/04107.wav|Beastly creature, I know not what to do with him.
wavs/06575.wav|Blunt, LEAD him hence; and see you guard him sure.
wavs/01642.wav|Have you attempted to commit suicide in the last ten years?
wavs/03514.wav|They say they send their dough to Petersburg.
wavs/04220.wav|I am afraid we should not think they were very nice people nowadays.
wavs/00239.wav|And the moment of joy is upon us.
wavs/02736.wav|Thank you so much. Stop. We'll talk later.
wavs/06576.wav|Can you meet me with the letters and other trifles?
wavs/04420.wav|I am glad I am not the child!
wavs/06485.wav|She called the maid back. Now let us sum up.
wavs/04344.wav|Go on.
wavs/04815.wav|We have finished with the witnesses in this hearing.
wavs/00322.wav|Oh not much. I got a job. That's great.
wavs/01637.wav|Of course I wanna sign you! Miss Leonard, I'm so Oh, boy.
wavs/06742.wav|We are here at peace. Do you mean you would keep me by force?
wavs/02192.wav|Now go away so we can talk about you.
wavs/06520.wav|Nothing worse? Then my shout reached her ears.
wavs/05143.wav|It is my duty also to know men and countries outside the empire.
wavs/02777.wav|I hope you can find some way to be happy for me.
wavs/01485.wav|I need help!
wavs/02770.wav|Has the tumour recurred?
wavs/02206.wav|And mean. And frightening.
wavs/01405.wav|Why don't I just join you both there? Apparently, they're attracted to dryer sheets.
wavs/04570.wav|I have to rely entirely upon your mercy.
wavs/00350.wav|What? And something else.
wavs/01246.wav|So I'll see you tomorrow.
wavs/00465.wav|What symptoms do you currently have?
wavs/02100.wav|Do you currently suffer from this condition?
wavs/05017.wav|Here are a thousand francs, bully that you are!
wavs/06383.wav|She told Emilia that she must leave her; her husband wished it. She was almost ferocious.
wavs/04449.wav|In short: We have confined ourselves long enough to the mere study of our legal canons.
wavs/05503.wav|He had had no thought save the thought of seeing Esther.
wavs/02097.wav|Now everything's screwed up.
wavs/03437.wav|I want your whole body. No humbug, eh?
wavs/01586.wav|What do you think? It's very clean. Really, it looks great!
wavs/00191.wav|Most people, when their pets pass on
wavs/02504.wav|What is the purpose of your travel or stay?
wavs/00819.wav|Oh I'm a senior
wavs/03861.wav|Your fortune? My mind is made up now!
wavs/06216.wav|Sometimes men are infatuated, and write what they do not mean.
wavs/03494.wav|I inquires. But shift away: there's warrant in that theft Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.
wavs/00201.wav|Has any one of your natural parents, brothers or sisters been diagnosed with any form of Huntington's disease?
wavs/05939.wav|See I MIRACLES or pastimes? Go into prison.
wavs/01847.wav|What other licence do you hold?
wavs/04167.wav|There is with us. The times were troubled everywhere.
wavs/02520.wav|Stop it! Oh my God!
wavs/02913.wav|We can? Okay I'm trying that.
wavs/00040.wav|Please. That second time, you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup.
wavs/01016.wav|All right. Now, don't think of it as a cigarette.
wavs/05263.wav|It had not occurred to you to wonder? I was in for it now.
wavs/01619.wav|I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
wavs/02767.wav|Okay, here we go. Okay.
wavs/01252.wav|Will you help me? Please?
wavs/01734.wav|Now you're just tidying up. Okay. You want me to throw you? I can hop.
wavs/04070.wav|Yet now they fright me.
wavs/04882.wav|I followed with an open letter to many leading Democrats in the State.
wavs/01378.wav|Hold on. Fill these out. Sit over there! I don't want to make any trouble but I'm in a lot of pain.
wavs/01703.wav|But just barely and I. I've been talking about myself all night long. I'm sorry.
wavs/01865.wav|What is the percentage of the share capital the key person does own?
wavs/05344.wav|I thought she was here a minute ago.
wavs/05629.wav|I shall have enough left to reach the COUNTRY, by travelling on foot.
wavs/03908.wav|Indefinitely?
wavs/02137.wav|Lights still out? Yeah. Well maybe they're napping.
wavs/00481.wav|What type of surgery will be performed?
wavs/02903.wav|so then I figured maybe not.
wavs/01429.wav|but what the hell are you talking about? I mean, what about you? Me? I'm fine.
wavs/06709.wav|I've got to hold this job down a little longer.
wavs/03458.wav|That, he said, is a very just distinction.
wavs/06035.wav|What, on him? And where a tyrant sterner?
wavs/00807.wav|Let me ask you. What did you get?
wavs/01851.wav|What caused your back pains?
wavs/00184.wav|Where are your activities carried out?
wavs/05365.wav|Lily had resolved to be of the party.
wavs/05838.wav|The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
wavs/06026.wav|Trust Crab Jones. At that word she was at his feet, clutching him.
wavs/06338.wav|I think you'd like him.
wavs/00695.wav|Is your blood being tested?
wavs/05333.wav|After music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be trained.
wavs/00538.wav|so tight.
wavs/04696.wav|Be grateful.
wavs/04071.wav|Fray, fight.
wavs/04298.wav|He seemed to me sublime.
wavs/02428.wav|See? Call me!
wavs/03157.wav|I don't wanna do that. I had the most supremely awful day.
wavs/05785.wav|I tried to make him.
wavs/01390.wav|Does anyone wanna see? No thanks!
wavs/00450.wav|Ow! Okay.
wavs/01490.wav|Have you undergone Allergy immunotherapy?
wavs/03675.wav|The hail had brought about a change of atmosphere.
wavs/05281.wav|I told that pushing young journalist all I KNEW and a bit more.
wavs/04239.wav|Shepherds were seen running down from the mountains.
wavs/04330.wav|Won't you walk in? The woman seemed to shrink away.
wavs/04006.wav|Besides, I like trailing along, if you don't mind.
wavs/05591.wav|What if I were to try such and SUCH a thing?
wavs/05202.wav|He surveyed the crowd with cynical, dissatisfied eyes.
wavs/02483.wav|and saying it went to live on a farm.
wavs/04026.wav|Will that do? Under the name of a "republic" he erected a despotism and usurped powers such as no Russian autocrat would dare claim. Were we mistaken?
wavs/02224.wav|Always yelling. Nothing made him happy. Not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle.
wavs/03247.wav|And then you put your arms around me.
wavs/06732.wav|They had entered the building long before he came in sight of it.
wavs/05962.wav|But here in this land the men are pure males.
wavs/05638.wav|Harriet may pick and chuse. She had got an idea.
wavs/06522.wav|Which of the two men was young, and which was old?
wavs/00226.wav|I didn't know anybody here. You ready? No, how can I be ready?
wavs/04874.wav|Intellectually, at LEAST, their attitude sets gravity at defiance.
wavs/00857.wav|I suddenly had the feeling
wavs/00663.wav|You'll go back to being who you were. That's who you are.
wavs/02433.wav|How are you? Yes, I heard. Congratulations. That is so great.
wavs/02473.wav|That's fine. It is?
wavs/02885.wav|It's not mine I didn't earn it
wavs/06639.wav|Then he rather expected to finish somebody in that way!
wavs/02128.wav|After a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better
wavs/04805.wav|Would I WEAR so fair on my journey!
wavs/06124.wav|You're crazy.
wavs/01231.wav|No we hate him!
wavs/05618.wav|No great artist ever sees things as they really are.
wavs/05084.wav|I wouldn't have missed it on any account.
wavs/00141.wav|What did you mean by that? It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues
wavs/06059.wav|Did you enjoy your holiday? I am going to be married to him.
wavs/01536.wav|What were you going to say? Oh, God! I'm so sorry.
wavs/00928.wav|Where? Where we've been looking all night. He's so cute. George, baby, drop the towel.
wavs/03669.wav|I could not sleep, and I have a frightful headache.
wavs/00930.wav|What proportion of the gross profit can be attributed to the key person?
wavs/03461.wav|It is because Carthage possesses it that Carthage is powerful.
wavs/00964.wav|And just think
wavs/03464.wav|For an instant it must have ceased to beat.
wavs/02742.wav|That'd be cool.
wavs/02881.wav|When did you last use recreational drugs?
wavs/01068.wav|Yeah, this one goes across the street. I gave him yours. Bonehead! Bonehead! When you do that, you're only hitting yourself.
wavs/05932.wav|There are some touching illusions which are, PERHAPS, sublime realities.
wavs/02402.wav|and disturbing about that.
wavs/06521.wav|The French say that one person turns the cheek and the other kisses it.
wavs/01041.wav|Okay I'll be there. That was my agent.
wavs/05199.wav|She wandered from room to room and could find nothing to amuse her.
wavs/01128.wav|Excellent dream score.
wavs/02725.wav|And I don't appreciate it. Yeah, I can see you right now. Hello?
wavs/01505.wav|Look! There's a note on the back. She was obviously very moved!
wavs/03083.wav|guys don't do anything that comes close. Right?
wavs/01863.wav|When did the oxygen therapy start?
wavs/05275.wav|I am going to see.
wavs/01575.wav|No thanks I'm married. 
wavs/04313.wav|But she thought it necessary to apologise again; she had been talking too much.
wavs/04925.wav|Till you know better how to handle it. Bless you!
wavs/01990.wav|And this is my reward.
wavs/01916.wav|Guess what? You got a job?
wavs/00291.wav|Done with the bookcase. All finished.
wavs/00200.wav|Has anybody seen my engagement ring? It's beautiful. Oh God! Oh
wavs/04132.wav|He brought her only disapproval.
wavs/03287.wav|What medications are you taking? In which time and in which frequency did you take the medication?
wavs/05664.wav|So one glance EXCHANGED between Mme. I like to watch your lips talking.
wavs/01088.wav|We might be leaving now.
wavs/06597.wav|Curse life!
wavs/01256.wav|So how's it going in Financial Services?
wavs/05448.wav|The King!
wavs/05376.wav|I have nowhere to go to. Directly I am successful, I'll join you again.
wavs/01978.wav|Spit. What?
wavs/01975.wav|It doesn't matter to me.
wavs/06380.wav|How many of you saw Light in the room?
wavs/02053.wav|Which is the result of your last test? When?
wavs/02756.wav|When did you last have symptoms?
wavs/06744.wav|He Bites.
wavs/03907.wav|Ay, if!
wavs/03856.wav|Poor old man, he would be greatly embarrassed to offer her anything else.
wavs/01180.wav|I'll be just as pathetic as you. Yeah, you wish.
wavs/05379.wav|She had slipped away among the shadows of the night.
wavs/02032.wav|Do you expect changes in your authorisations in the next two years?
wavs/04935.wav|By you?
wavs/00848.wav|I just can't believe this!
wavs/03230.wav|Does you allergy effect your airway? for example wheezing, coughing breathing difficulties.
wavs/06584.wav|He was rich; he was a GENTLEMAN of ancient lineage; he bore an unblemished character.
wavs/03419.wav|Her words fairly drove him wild. But I suppose you had no opportunity.
wavs/05016.wav|This is the manner of beggars and of wandering men.
wavs/00789.wav|I don't want you taking that thing this late.
wavs/03573.wav|Yes, I HAILED the Swallow.
wavs/00861.wav|Please provide details of the result
wavs/00570.wav|starts yelling. Something about how it was her cab first. The next thing, she just starts pulling me out by my hair!
wavs/04623.wav|See chap.
wavs/00183.wav|He's kind of like the guy I went to see that with. Except he's smarter and gentler and sweeter.
wavs/01276.wav|Just for the hell of it.
wavs/00206.wav|The bottom line is smoking is cool, and you know it.
wavs/02383.wav|is the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
wavs/00017.wav|This man child has no problem with how old you are?
wavs/01930.wav|And action! And action!
wavs/05601.wav|I hear the trampling of horse. No one throws anything away any more.
wavs/00253.wav|How many sessions did you receive?
wavs/05248.wav|We took no other men.
wavs/04372.wav|I know; I've tried to quit, but I never will while I'm here.
wavs/06754.wav|Perhaps you'll drive up sometime.
wavs/00071.wav|Kids new dream.
wavs/02857.wav|We weren't happy.
wavs/02571.wav|We gotta do something.
wavs/06653.wav|They had their source only in her vanity.
wavs/01196.wav|Want this? Oh, thanks. Sure.
wavs/04667.wav|The two men sat for several moments without further speech.
wavs/01302.wav|We loved him!
wavs/01137.wav|When was the surgery?
wavs/02704.wav|You'd go out with someone going out with someone else?
wavs/01034.wav|Yes? Hi.
wavs/03258.wav|Can we have three chocolate mousses to go?
wavs/06622.wav|The people to whom she was indebted made "scenes" and gave her no peace.
wavs/01838.wav|Did an accident directly cause the loss?
wavs/02318.wav|Hi. Thanks. Hi.
wavs/04036.wav|But, my dear, what is there charming about her?
wavs/02395.wav|What are you doing here?
wavs/01151.wav|Yes yes! Like the man in the shoe! What shoe?
wavs/04453.wav|I went out myself and bought her a toy.
wavs/06573.wav|By right because I am the senior captain. Now you speak!
wavs/05052.wav|Oh, how I wish I was traveling by railway!
wavs/05131.wav|I am wondrous merry hearted, I COULD laugh now.
wavs/00851.wav|Okay maybe I will. Good night. Good night.
wavs/06169.wav|My eyes, dazzled with the outer LIGHT, could distinguish nothing.
wavs/06253.wav|He has simply become a superfluous person. Who with?
wavs/02070.wav|It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues
wavs/02925.wav|Sounds like a date to me.
wavs/05406.wav|Miss Lucas is married and settled. He was arming himself as he spoke.
wavs/05519.wav|Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual.
wavs/02037.wav|You're, you're. What? Oh my God!
wavs/05489.wav|He fell backwards and did not stir again.
wavs/00101.wav|I don't know. I thought it looked better there. And also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
wavs/04099.wav|I had strangely overlooked these. Did papa see him? I will not stay here!
wavs/05594.wav|It's the funny way you've done up YOUR hair.
wavs/06737.wav|Glad ways and words remembered would shame the wretched year.
wavs/00368.wav|you're gonna live by my rules.
wavs/05520.wav|He saw that I was not following him, and spoke out more plainly.
wavs/06528.wav|That's talking! We had them with their backs to the sea.
wavs/06611.wav|And nobody knows that the angels can read writing, anyway.
wavs/01765.wav|Just find out what they want. Okay. No you do it.
wavs/06240.wav|He paused, with his foot in the stirrup.
wavs/01253.wav|Are you under medical supervision by a physician?
wavs/01064.wav|What are you doing? I've been thinking
wavs/00610.wav|Have you had any digestive disorder symptoms or follow up treatment since your surgery?
wavs/00422.wav|when this woman, this blond planet with a pocketbook
wavs/05494.wav|The porter shut the street door, the windows became dark.
wavs/02315.wav|This blows!
wavs/05820.wav|Only remember, I'm not always going to do this for you.
wavs/03690.wav|This, to some of us males, seems anything but logical.
wavs/06028.wav|They only care for their pheasants and their peasants.
wavs/06331.wav|I do remember! Still the mad forces, though the scarred.
wavs/00270.wav|Did I miss something? It was an accident.
wavs/02570.wav|Look at me spilling everywhere. Everybody it's Fun Bobby!
wavs/02197.wav|I'm Like those women that you see
wavs/04987.wav|The most imaginative races have proved the greatest factors in the world's advance.
wavs/04640.wav|He was nowhere at hand. Yes, what it is?
wavs/02749.wav|I went across the street to the doorman. Can I use your phone?
wavs/06131.wav|Things are as they are.
wavs/00233.wav|No I'm not. Alright we have to talk.
wavs/02051.wav|What other type do you practice? Please indicate the kind of motor cycle, races, annual frequency, participation in competitions, etc.
wavs/05723.wav|The "Public Man" says that THERE was little enthusiasm.
wavs/00579.wav|That's all you wanted to ask? That's all! What?
wavs/04441.wav|As the colonel was getting ready to retire a servant brought him a note.
wavs/05085.wav|But a horrible abyss lay between it and the plateau. Yes, Monsieur keeper.
wavs/02609.wav|Apparently, they're attracted to dryer sheets. They're going in fine, but they're coming out all fluffy.
wavs/05568.wav|Well, I ain't. And are you COMFORTABLE at the inn?
wavs/01987.wav|By whom was the calculation made?
wavs/02322.wav|That is so unfair!
wavs/03404.wav|Ha, monsieur, deformed folks are born a hundred years old.
wavs/01259.wav|Yeah, but there were no suds. So?
wavs/01775.wav|and take some punches. This feels great. I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
wavs/03064.wav|If you are working on a ship, do you return to the mainland daily?
wavs/03188.wav|That's it. Are you going to crash on the couch? No, I gotta go home sometime. Are you gonna be okay?
wavs/02632.wav|So got any advice? You should try not to look too terrific. I know it'll be hard.
wavs/05750.wav|He neither liked nor disliked Gregory, but he suspected him of rather bullying Beverly.
wavs/02440.wav|What is it, that she left you for another woman that likes women? Then what?
wavs/05988.wav|"Yes, yes," cried the boys; "let's set about it!" We will obey you.
wavs/01690.wav|outside of his window, full of possibilities.
wavs/00907.wav|One mushroom green pepper and onion? No, no, no. That's not what we ordered!
wavs/01472.wav|It's just.
wavs/03055.wav|When was your last surgery?
wavs/06723.wav|I can almost smell the rubber of my tires burning.
wavs/01764.wav|You just have
wavs/04784.wav|Dolly was ill at ease, and tried to find a subject of conversation.
wavs/05232.wav|I thought it delicious. Mother!
wavs/04684.wav|I advanced towards her, hardly conscious of what I was doing.
wavs/00962.wav|Good. Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
wavs/06582.wav|I am dying, Egypt, dying: Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.
wavs/03645.wav|He bowed, and escaped, unsuspected, from the room.
wavs/01890.wav|Thanks. You're a good kid. I'll show you to my room.
wavs/03253.wav|Have you had laser corrective surgery or lens implantation?
wavs/06055.wav|He began to writhe again in his chair.
wavs/00970.wav|You told your sister that? Believe me, I told everyone.
wavs/00431.wav|My face is dented. Well, you'll have to wait your turn. How long do you think it will be? Any minute now.
wavs/04629.wav|Heaven forbid that we should lose it! How now, madam!
wavs/01179.wav|How often do you suffer with symptoms each year?
wavs/03227.wav|Yeah. I think you have to draw him out.
wavs/05165.wav|Then word from the Sovereigns, and it was here indignant, and here comforting.
wavs/05729.wav|Quite ignorant.
wavs/03547.wav|She will break it to you better than I CAN. Not yet, Monsieur.
wavs/06763.wav|What a romance! It was midnight before she dismissed me.
wavs/01313.wav|You actually broke her watch? Steer clear of you. That's right.
wavs/00564.wav|What is going on?
wavs/03183.wav|Are you performing this activity abroad?
wavs/01047.wav|it's worth it okay? In a relationship, you have these key moments
wavs/06287.wav|He marvelled now at his own perverse folly.
wavs/04837.wav|He stopped short and wavered for a moment, being unarmed and sharply surprised.
wavs/02205.wav|Basically, we just feel that he's. We hate that guy!
wavs/04127.wav|He conferred with them confidentially. They know what they want.
wavs/02599.wav|That was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now!
wavs/05528.wav|But this was an error.
wavs/00683.wav|Do you also fly with historic aircrafts?
wavs/03333.wav|Judge Wheeling ran an uncomfortable finger around his collar's edge. I torment you, Wilfrid.
wavs/03433.wav|Tis simple as Scripture HISTORY. We will stand the loss.
wavs/02252.wav|Really? I don't remember you making any sperm. And we all know what a challenge that is.
wavs/01806.wav|Please give details on the function of the key person and the amount
wavs/06280.wav|Some old FORGOTTEN Law, to do such deeds?
wavs/03921.wav|Why should he write to you? I was speaking of your bodily condition.
wavs/01682.wav|I thought you'd need it tomorrow. Thank you.
wavs/01295.wav|You got the whole night? Do I sense resentment?
wavs/01284.wav|Just to compare.
wavs/02415.wav|Do you have joint symptoms?
wavs/01084.wav|Which events or races do you participate in?
wavs/06759.wav|Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
wavs/03113.wav|Which other circulatory disease do you suffer from?
wavs/00439.wav|Please indicate the type of aircraft
wavs/05161.wav|What monstrous apparition, Exceeding fierce, that none may pass that way?
wavs/05915.wav|The trouble was that they were not alluring.
wavs/06364.wav|The little people, the poor, the unhappy, well, what of them?
wavs/04549.wav|It is so Nature is made: it is so Dante discerned that she was made. I pointed to the mist, passing through the gate with me.
wavs/00512.wav|Here goes. All right I can do this.
wavs/06501.wav|He will release you. As much to you, good sister!
wavs/05080.wav|Then he began to talk. To good King Charles.
wavs/01915.wav|We've been here for over an hour, and people less sick have gone in. That guy with the toe thing, who's he sleeping with?
wavs/06787.wav|He would have to stand on the facts.
wavs/00556.wav|Does it get better than this?
wavs/00329.wav|Bye, everybody. Bye. I don't know.
wavs/03058.wav|Do you have the qualifications to exercise these activities?
wavs/00631.wav|No it is me. You know, when I'm with her, I'm so much more than that.
wavs/03900.wav|It fitted into the thickness of the partition wall, and worked in grooves.
wavs/00179.wav|Do you take part in downhill mountain biking for pleasure only?
wavs/06040.wav|More rushes, more rushes. No one in the VILLAGE even knows how she lives.
wavs/01578.wav|I'm looking. I'm looking. I'm looking.
wavs/02525.wav|No I'm fine. Just
wavs/04872.wav|The train was starting and we bought our PAPERS to beguile the road.
wavs/02282.wav|She's gonna break the pact. No! No, no.
wavs/05153.wav|Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.
wavs/03320.wav|We got trashy magazines. We got cookie dough. We got Twister.
wavs/04995.wav|What price do you set on my obedience?
wavs/00282.wav|So what do you want?
wavs/05506.wav|And I come here every day of late, holy father, to take a peep.
wavs/00207.wav|Would you stop? Was I doing it again? Yes!
wavs/03255.wav|The exclamation point scares me.
wavs/04646.wav|But he didn't seize my throat. This is the natural RELIGION of the world.
wavs/05788.wav|Was his face at all disfigured? How do you suppose he is feeling?
wavs/05147.wav|In them she drowned what brains she possessed.
wavs/05922.wav|When see!
wavs/01763.wav|To play with or simply let hang
wavs/00063.wav|This blows! I know. Why can't parents just stay parents?
wavs/06502.wav|How did you pick up with the Major?
wavs/03619.wav|This handkerchief was stained with blood. Columbus, in return, made him a present.
wavs/03185.wav|Off to see young Ethan? Thank you.
wavs/05156.wav|At the time of her arrest, she stated that prostitution was her occupation.
wavs/04579.wav|The grandmother said nothing, she did not wish to spoil the child's pleasure.
wavs/03587.wav|All the rest of the families, families and families apart, and their women apart.
wavs/05958.wav|The people wonder what new spirit has seized us now.
wavs/02414.wav|When were you diagnosed with your mental complaints?
wavs/06288.wav|You are an EARLY visitor.
wavs/03870.wav|Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear.
wavs/06311.wav|Oh, obey orders and stop here, I suppose.
wavs/02753.wav|What treatment did you use?
wavs/04257.wav|And if there are not two, there is no contact?
wavs/06396.wav|Paul takes the false apostles to task for their flattery.
wavs/01431.wav|What complications or complaints did you suffer?
wavs/06617.wav|After whose birth, she ceased to bear any more.
wavs/05818.wav|All her beautiful hair had been drawn back and plaited.
wavs/00678.wav|Do you usually use the same aircraft?
wavs/02227.wav|You're fine yeah
wavs/04914.wav|Lingard.
wavs/02146.wav|You can't do this. Do what?
wavs/06472.wav|The waiter, on his return, not being able to find it, seemed surprised.
wavs/06031.wav|I could seek my brother in that town.
wavs/02986.wav|Yeah a quality.
wavs/03950.wav|Marcus hasn't the least bit of right to it.
wavs/00787.wav|I'm working tomorrow, but if you want, you can come by if you'd like. Great.
wavs/02876.wav|It was unbelievable.
wavs/06785.wav|Your FRENCH is such a relief to her.
wavs/01954.wav|Well, not myself. But I know other people that have. How'd that happen? My God!
wavs/06453.wav|Conventions and harangues never ceased.
wavs/00008.wav|I can't do this. I know you can. No. You made coffee, you can do anything.
wavs/00015.wav|How long did you stay in the hospital?
wavs/05924.wav|I must to him too, Before he go to bed.
wavs/02208.wav|You got way too much free time man.
wavs/00036.wav|this is not my You know what? This is too hard.
wavs/00958.wav|Horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
wavs/03298.wav|Easy we'll find it. Won't we?
wavs/01096.wav|I know it's gonna be really hard. Well he's a big boy
wavs/06285.wav|Such singing!
wavs/03808.wav|The next instant the room was buried in obscurity.
wavs/04470.wav|For, if they ARE, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.
wavs/03069.wav|emotionally stunted
wavs/05658.wav|Think of a new face, seen in your house!
wavs/00230.wav|What is the purpose of the loan?
wavs/01191.wav|and I cannot feel my legs.
wavs/01367.wav|and within five minutes they're all over him. Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef,
wavs/06493.wav|But the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again. But he only said "Oh yes," impatiently, and went away.
wavs/05572.wav|You've never heard about my clothes, have you, Daddy?
wavs/05239.wav|And he waited with impatience for the coming of night.
wavs/02716.wav|Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
wavs/06006.wav|Grace and remembrance be to you both! You made a note of that?
wavs/05146.wav|Do you think I can WAIT when business is in question?
wavs/02934.wav|I don't know. He's a great guy
wavs/03704.wav|Did you not say the Devil hindered you?
wavs/05943.wav|You would have been happy. When love of country shall be real again!
wavs/00960.wav|You know what? It looks fine.
wavs/04547.wav|What, should I don this robe and trouble you? He looked where I pointed.
wavs/00059.wav|Just a touch.
wavs/05105.wav|The Baron smiled faintly. I learned my golf here with King, the professional.
wavs/02295.wav|Have you had surgery for this complaint?
wavs/01999.wav|Right. Well we never actually got to that.
wavs/06572.wav|He's not round much in the evenings now.
wavs/02670.wav|What you guys doing here? We are here to break up with you.
wavs/02902.wav|It says to call if you're not satisfied with this candy bar.
wavs/04464.wav|The trouble is labor ain't quite got its eyes open.
wavs/01183.wav|What is the nature of your business?
wavs/04231.wav|He has only just told me that his sight is beginning to fail.
wavs/01571.wav|and tied it around my neck. Cookie? Carol moved her stuff out today.
wavs/02400.wav|Do you? No!
wavs/05887.wav|Those districts were placed under the command of Major Generals.
wavs/02973.wav|But look how straight those noodles are.
wavs/05882.wav|No one cares in the least what she does.
wavs/06503.wav|Well now?
wavs/02226.wav|and this!
wavs/01471.wav|You'll Never Make it on Your Own. Are you gonna go over there? No.
wavs/00497.wav|Have you been hospitalised in the last two years?
wavs/06703.wav|The war had brought him enormous increase in his collection.
wavs/03351.wav|To the death, my lord. Resolutely you refuse?
wavs/02317.wav|Is your blood being examined?
wavs/00655.wav|I just Oh, Barry, this was not good. No, it was. It was very, very good.
wavs/01884.wav|Where? Oh. Well.
wavs/04856.wav|This is essential for me, for YOU, and for our son.
wavs/05860.wav|Such students would not be likely to have many or perhaps any books.
wavs/01217.wav|What was the reason for this examination or treatment?
wavs/03679.wav|I don't believe it. You told your father?
wavs/00479.wav|Yeah, we all have jobs. That's how we buy stuff.
wavs/04769.wav|Then ended with an oath.
wavs/06747.wav|Now for the day after. He mustn't, he mustn't.
wavs/04246.wav|Pardon my rudeness. He's going to stay a whole week.
wavs/06016.wav|At all events, I rejoice in your present safety. Hold the DOGS, Philip!
wavs/02953.wav|Uh oh! The laundry's done
wavs/00534.wav|You all know my dad right?
wavs/00454.wav|Have you fully recovered and returned to normal work or activity?
wavs/04921.wav|Certainly ruined villages were only found very near the Front.
wavs/03006.wav|Why don't you just call her?
wavs/02441.wav|one! Happy New Year!
wavs/00568.wav|Why do we keep ending up together? New Year's, who invited who? You seek me out!
wavs/00985.wav|You're having an affair, I chop garlic. It's a wacky world. I don't know. Then you haven't.
wavs/02653.wav|if I can actually do my own laundry
wavs/03574.wav|It was, AFTER all, to their benefit to answer the questions.
wavs/02389.wav|Oh my God Chi Chi!
wavs/02066.wav|Does your job involve hazardous duties?
wavs/03913.wav|"It is no good," said Rosamund, with real tears in her eyes; "one can never go back."
wavs/03268.wav|Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, you know? Once again, rolling. Water working.
wavs/00142.wav|When did the fracture occur?
wavs/04505.wav|The lack of courage creates financial, as well as mental and moral difficulties.
wavs/06185.wav|Then you'll say it at Bennington next week.
wavs/02956.wav|That's right. Alrighty bye bye.
wavs/04744.wav|He's in a scrape, mother.
wavs/02841.wav|Since when do you do your motor racing activities?
wavs/01783.wav|than going back and forth on the ferry. Good to meet you. You too.
wavs/04494.wav|Your lively MIND can hardly be serious even on serious subjects.
wavs/02960.wav|What is the degree of your disability?
wavs/03590.wav|He's not sick, is he?
wavs/02412.wav|Wait a minute! We're talking about someone I'm going out with?
wavs/02557.wav|Is the impaired hearing
wavs/00397.wav|My way? You think this is my way?
wavs/01949.wav|I can't believe I'm considering this.
wavs/06227.wav|Shall our coffers, then, Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
wavs/03757.wav|Nor for ze look now on your face.
wavs/04364.wav|Out came the watch; he stared at nothing.
wavs/04715.wav|But it takes in more.
wavs/05825.wav|Seen from the mountain brow, enormous good, I think.
wavs/02914.wav|What's going on? You go out with tons of girls.
wavs/00808.wav|Just to compare. Let's see.
wavs/03099.wav|sliding your foot so far up my leg
wavs/02569.wav|Give me a for instance. Well, I don't know. Sorry about that.
wavs/03347.wav|Upon what point? The Spirit of American Government.
wavs/00162.wav|Did I miss something?
wavs/00265.wav|That's fine. That's great. Okay.
wavs/00680.wav|When do you intend to travel?
wavs/03668.wav|I hope we may; for we are giving ourselves trouble enough on her account.
wavs/06106.wav|Fury, Fury!
wavs/06038.wav|Still, let us make the best of it.
wavs/05691.wav|I study.
wavs/04843.wav|"You will hang me," he said, "to frighten my brother foxes." I stood firm.
wavs/05224.wav|He understands.
wavs/05551.wav|The jury of which you spoke has met: a mixed jury and a merciful.
wavs/01811.wav|That's fine. Thank you. Next. How did he do this?
wavs/03938.wav|The roast!
wavs/05029.wav|He rang for his servant. It did help him.
wavs/06301.wav|Everything has two names, and everything is twofold.
wavs/04931.wav|Nell was giving utterance to nearly his own thoughts.
wavs/06752.wav|Oh, but I'm glad you came, Tom! "Dances, too," he said; "dances were not frivolous."
wavs/00156.wav|I'm better off staying with the kid
wavs/04740.wav|Society would not have given and denied her caresses.
wavs/02814.wav|Have you had surgery for your complaints?
wavs/02275.wav|Right. Well, we never actually got to that. It was just so nice to see him again.
wavs/01467.wav|Hi how was the game? Well
wavs/06483.wav|I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths By this device.
wavs/03378.wav|I have the stronger hand.
wavs/00900.wav|Others are satisfied with staying where they are.
wavs/04138.wav|"The last," he murmured, "the last of this silly universe."
wavs/02215.wav|C'mon!
wavs/05487.wav|If the question had been asked in past days: Who is the brightest and HAPPIEST member of the family?
wavs/03539.wav|It's the FIRST time he's been here since she told him he mustn't come.
wavs/03465.wav|That her body should have been left was not wonderful! Come here, Romulus!
wavs/03934.wav|The coward!
wavs/05934.wav|She was talking half to herself. No; that is not reasonable. Why, you're real kind!
wavs/00390.wav|Something went wrong
wavs/05582.wav|If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
wavs/04427.wav|"Then I shall always call you by that name," said Clara, "it suits you."
wavs/00995.wav|Love you.
wavs/03998.wav|The Magic will tell me.
wavs/03745.wav|And disappointment have us in a net. You have not merely learned: it is your mother tongue. It is a great deal.
wavs/06745.wav|"Yes," replied the Bishop, "you are called my brother." Will you come help me, quick? Some one no doubt had urged her.
wavs/05912.wav|He stroked his mustache, and returned to his petticoat government.
wavs/00110.wav|What activity do you do?
wavs/06798.wav|A discovered a principle upon which success depended.
wavs/02743.wav|I used all the attachments on the vacuum except for that round one.
wavs/02998.wav|Nothing to see here. Okay. Let's do laundry.
wavs/06822.wav|It was a dying crew that took her out.
wavs/00487.wav|What treatment did you have?
wavs/06510.wav|We have promised them solemnly that we would.
wavs/05374.wav|All that Marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent.
wavs/02443.wav|Well she has issues.
wavs/03821.wav|Lucien was thoughtful and sad for a few minutes.
wavs/05935.wav|As near the dawning, Provost, as it is, You shall hear more ere morning.
wavs/04734.wav|Was not she the WHOLE day with you?
wavs/05288.wav|O heaven, What more then man is this!
wavs/05091.wav|I am very old and my memory begins to play me strange tricks.
wavs/06578.wav|I rang the bell, and he came to the door.
wavs/05492.wav|Let us find a higher outlook on life than theirs.
wavs/06494.wav|Without irreparable injury to ourselves we cannot attempt to eradicate it or extirpate it.
wavs/03638.wav|His activity was ceaseless, and his ambition was boundless.
wavs/04013.wav|Oh, what formality, what square observance, Lives in a little room!
wavs/00892.wav|What was the diagnosis?
wavs/01721.wav|I have to. Look, she's leaving. I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
wavs/01595.wav|Do you still have symptoms or complications due to the disorder?
wavs/03930.wav|The priests did not neglect the natural means of healing.
wavs/06499.wav|The easy LANDLORD pressed her back into her chair.
wavs/03009.wav|Did you have surgery for your complaints?
wavs/05779.wav|And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his eyes.
wavs/01148.wav|When were you diagnosed with raised cholesterol?
wavs/06411.wav|The only Secret contained in this book is revealed midway in the first volume.
wavs/01129.wav|And I figure if you can be honest, then I can too.
wavs/01478.wav|Okay, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. You look good.
wavs/06546.wav|You're a stubborn fool, Robert. How know you did believe?
wavs/06090.wav|I HAVE no tongue, sir.
wavs/03836.wav|Are they still acquainted? Let sleeping dogs lie.
wavs/04197.wav|Is there any difference in the soil inside and out?
wavs/04796.wav|O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
wavs/03358.wav|It was the appointed business of that morning.
wavs/00215.wav|Don't tell me I did it wrong. Nothing wrong about that.
wavs/02948.wav|What's the matter? Nothing.
wavs/00769.wav|I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room! What are you doing? Getting comfortable.
wavs/06116.wav|It only remains to be decided how we can best dispose of yourself.
wavs/03228.wav|Is your problem completely cured?
wavs/05722.wav|Mr. Bent was followed by Richard Williams, who remained two years.
wavs/01188.wav|but I'll start him off against a blind rabbit
wavs/06623.wav|Nay then, give him another staff: this last was broke cross. Are you the butcher, Suffolk?
wavs/06812.wav|Yet I am not going to praise either Mr. Thackeray or his book.
wavs/05673.wav|One might almost say: There will be no more events. Help me out.
wavs/01606.wav|A little. Just a little.
wavs/02675.wav|What do I do? Everyone starts looking at me. They weren't looking at you before?
wavs/05826.wav|She WILL give you my journal. A hunt!
wavs/05567.wav|She drew back, indeed, as she entered the room.
wavs/03383.wav|Is that somebody above? She stays with her aunt.
wavs/06728.wav|The tea was brought in before Emily could reply.
wavs/01665.wav|Do you smoke?
wavs/03435.wav|Examine yourself!
wavs/00906.wav|I don't care how old you are, while you're here
wavs/00416.wav|There'll be a lot of babes in San Diego
wavs/04984.wav|I wonder if it was that he was hinting at all the while!
wavs/06428.wav|Away, away with the Atheist!
wavs/02017.wav|You realize the odds of that happening are a little slimmer
wavs/00929.wav|The laundry's done
wavs/01648.wav|Cut. Cut. Cut.
wavs/02029.wav|I love it when we share.
wavs/05677.wav|Who can tell what notions he has in his head?
wavs/01251.wav|Okay, would you just take him away? Just take him. Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand
wavs/05549.wav|Your master's one fault is that he is too fond of giving parties.
wavs/00229.wav|Yeah we're kind of a thing now. You got plugs!
wavs/02238.wav|How do I look? I don't care.
wavs/04622.wav|Only we must go unseen.
wavs/06054.wav|And no signature! Do you call him father?
wavs/00704.wav|Gee, no one's ever put it like that before. Well okay. Thanks.
wavs/00855.wav|No. No.
wavs/03192.wav|What other races do you participate in?
wavs/03559.wav|Weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you!
wavs/01738.wav|would be yes. Yes I was. Sure.
wavs/00943.wav|What about you? Tell me your stories. All right once
wavs/04645.wav|Such was the Scholastic Philosophy.
wavs/03767.wav|We both turned about, and found ourselves face to face with Sergeant Cuff.
wavs/01520.wav|I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
wavs/05747.wav|She's more like her mother used to be.
wavs/06354.wav|Then they clapped him on the back and he left them.
wavs/05449.wav|At a great distance yonder. To be sure I should.
wavs/00095.wav|Yeah so what?
wavs/05711.wav|But the human body, REGARDED as a body, is neither good nor evil?
wavs/05566.wav|Miss Garth shook her head.
wavs/04300.wav|To business.
wavs/03202.wav|That's okay.
wavs/05529.wav|He started to go on with her, but Long thrust in front again.
wavs/03479.wav|The crisis of his country was just at hand. I turned to Anne.
wavs/03504.wav|The reader already knows how much these two had to tell one another.
wavs/03032.wav|Hi. Hey.
wavs/04514.wav|And I remember thinking that the poem was nonsense.
wavs/05092.wav|He gently detached her arms.
wavs/02803.wav|When did the disease first occur?
wavs/01725.wav|What's what you were afraid of?
wavs/01761.wav|What's going on?
wavs/00341.wav|Yes it's working.
wavs/03658.wav|Have you a chair, ma'am? What fly has stung you?
wavs/01370.wav|That's ridiculous!
wavs/05372.wav|William deigned to correct her. Used to the feel of them, I suppose?
wavs/01059.wav|I'm not freaking out! I'm just saying
wavs/02493.wav|Why not? Because you're a kook!
wavs/01001.wav|Come on in. Thanks. Oh like five minutes.
wavs/01283.wav|No, it was. It was very, very good.
wavs/03992.wav|This seemed to be the time for her to begin. Yes, I am.
wavs/05126.wav|And he will be! I'll love you more afterward.
wavs/01144.wav|But it's not the one with the easy pour spout. Why would someone do that?
wavs/03597.wav|Time has given rest at last. Waldo looked at her.
wavs/01741.wav|I don't know. You decide.
wavs/00031.wav|Yeah I'm just working.
wavs/01470.wav|What? No suds no save
wavs/03665.wav|Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my sister with much tenderness. "You must do something," he said; "and it's for you to choose."
wavs/03039.wav|So how long have you been.
wavs/05537.wav|We have all gone to bed, no one is stirring.
wavs/00902.wav|Oh, sure it is. Oh, no, it isn't. What would make you think that?
wavs/01905.wav|You.
wavs/02527.wav|kind of had a little thing on the side. What?
wavs/05801.wav|Syllable, one of the distinct parts of a word.
wavs/03063.wav|I knew. You did?
wavs/05446.wav|Tom had appeared first to her tedious waiting.
wavs/04712.wav|Who Effected the Emancipation? Not since South Fork.
wavs/04345.wav|Down into the very midst of her writing came the bolts of death.
wavs/03860.wav|He stood in the middle of the room, with a gesture of command.
wavs/04105.wav|If I shall be judged, I know that I shall be found just.
wavs/04847.wav|Here, then, I tie my horse to this upright stone.
wavs/03395.wav|The house, his only visible possession, was mortgaged to its fullest selling value.
wavs/06549.wav|I dare not speak of it. I follow you.
wavs/03797.wav|I don't know those persons; they are villagers.
wavs/03957.wav|His property was entirely at his own disposal, and was of two kinds.
wavs/06601.wav|Good madam, let me see your face. Afterwards the moon rose.
wavs/04227.wav|O gull! Then I'm Clark. Hold your tongue.
wavs/05899.wav|But the thought of what was coming paralyzed me.
wavs/00043.wav|How did you know?
wavs/03610.wav|Lately I ordered my spies to watch him no longer.
wavs/02189.wav|What blood test has been carried out or being planned?
wavs/05973.wav|France lacked these, and the Germans thought she was doomed.
wavs/05420.wav|This led to many disputes between them, which made me miserable.
wavs/06436.wav|He was crooked of back, and quick of temper.
wavs/02972.wav|You can come in, but your filter tip little buddy stays outside! Thank you for calling.
wavs/05942.wav|I saw a large vessel pass the horizon struggling painfully.
wavs/01766.wav|They think you're a little. What?
wavs/02149.wav|What is the average duration of your flights?
wavs/05312.wav|Then she folded her arms across her breast and remained silent.
wavs/05135.wav|The great difficulty was in FINDING places to stop at night.
wavs/04270.wav|Are you the gentleman, sir, that offered half a crown?
wavs/00622.wav|That scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do. Oh God.
wavs/02746.wav|All right. Now we smoke.
wavs/05230.wav|Hy.
wavs/01537.wav|Please specify what surgery was performed
wavs/03170.wav|And the worst part is, it's with two different women. It's like if you woke up one day and found out
wavs/01264.wav|Ma I'm sorry.
wavs/04289.wav|I am, in fact, right because I cannot be wrong.
wavs/00873.wav|I'm looking. I got you What?
wavs/01278.wav|So what's up?
wavs/01538.wav|Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's.
wavs/01509.wav|But there's this other guy. He's saying, you know, This is too hard. Get out, get out! 
wavs/05888.wav|I didn't resist once; I didn't make any fight.
wavs/06480.wav|And when many days were passed, the Jews consulted together to kill him.
wavs/05911.wav|I always thought they had. Let them hang.
wavs/00559.wav|And I don't appreciate it okay? Yeah, I can see you right now. Hello?
wavs/06390.wav|You take Minna like an axe to hew me down.
wavs/04184.wav|I would subscribe fifty pounds a year to help it.
wavs/03871.wav|You'll spoil him if you don't watch out.
wavs/02321.wav|You know. Did he mention us?
wavs/01080.wav|How often have you suffered from this condition in the last five years?
wavs/02639.wav|When was the disorder first diagnosed?
wavs/05721.wav|It staggered ONE'S reason; the brain was numb with surprise.
wavs/02457.wav|I'm so glad.
wavs/05650.wav|One was that he was annoyed WITH Alice, but would dissemble his feelings.
wavs/00120.wav|Which medication do you use or have you used for your respiratory complaints?
wavs/03223.wav|That's funny!
wavs/03026.wav|This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi
wavs/05810.wav|They then began to dig twelve GRAVES with their swords.
wavs/00133.wav|So anyway
wavs/06404.wav|Let me think: for my mind cannot gallop like thine. The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
wavs/06309.wav|If she came here, you would listen to her? Oh, I won't believe that!
wavs/00281.wav|and that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father.
wavs/01713.wav|How did that happen?
wavs/01303.wav|Do you work seasonally limited?
wavs/00308.wav|Overall how often have your symptoms occurred?
wavs/00664.wav|Smile. I'm sorry. That's not funny. It's just.
wavs/05647.wav|None whatever!
wavs/03853.wav|He will be our helper, who was our Captain and Forerunner.
wavs/03444.wav|Ethical, political, and economic avenues of approach are insufficient.
wavs/06560.wav|Meanwhile, the traveller had risen to his feet. Sir Friar!
wavs/00608.wav|Thanks.
wavs/00451.wav|Well part of me wants that
wavs/00694.wav|I know this is gonna sound stupid
wavs/05436.wav|I have still to bring it to perfection.
wavs/04742.wav|Or if they do their blossoms droop and die.
wavs/02417.wav|They haven't even slept together yet. That's not serious.
wavs/02475.wav|they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could
wavs/02827.wav|This is madness I tell you. Thank you.
wavs/04954.wav|I think they are sound, good fellows at the bottom.
wavs/04580.wav|You CAUGHT me without any trouble, and yet you would not have me.
wavs/02660.wav|Do you smoke cigarettes, cigars or pipes?
wavs/03746.wav|You see so many people that I don't see.
wavs/06133.wav|There is no such country, there are no such people.
wavs/06488.wav|How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
wavs/02190.wav|Sure. Fine. Phoebe, you're on. Oh, good.
wavs/05082.wav|At that Israel began to curse and to swear.
wavs/04452.wav|Norah shivered, and thrust her hands deep into the pockets of her jacket.
wavs/06557.wav|From which a crime has been concluded. Here comes the man: to him, father; for I am a Jew, if I SERVE the Jew any longer.
wavs/02651.wav|Have you ever sustained an injury or accident on duty?
wavs/04627.wav|I delayed my speech somewhat.
wavs/02305.wav|Then I'm sorry. You're gonna be really hard to get over.
wavs/00528.wav|Yes? What you doing?
wavs/02598.wav|Did you have any spontaneous fracture?
wavs/00247.wav|And for him to have the courage to walk back in here
wavs/05735.wav|He has never left Paris!
wavs/02793.wav|Listen, why don't we just tell them who we really are?
wavs/03242.wav|With this ring no contest.
wavs/01486.wav|There. Now there is.
wavs/02472.wav|No? What happened big guy? Big guy?
wavs/06261.wav|You are, doubtless, a Princess?
wavs/03177.wav|She said yes! She said yes!
wavs/05010.wav|Some treason, masters; yet stand CLOSE. He counted the days.
wavs/01420.wav|but it's like I'm two guys. One guy's saying, This is great!
wavs/06444.wav|I inferred that the liquid must be an acid.
wavs/05872.wav|Now, what was Ned Land's opinion upon the question of the marine monster?
wavs/05078.wav|And I say, don't be such a goose!
wavs/00430.wav|and hope you'll accept this football phone
wavs/00539.wav|It's pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds!
wavs/03578.wav|It was, in fact, nothing more nor less than a gigantic boiler explosion.
wavs/04844.wav|That too?
wavs/06365.wav|He lifted her to her feet, and they staggered out together.
wavs/01387.wav|Hey you. So what's up?
wavs/00649.wav|At what age did the symptoms first occur?
wavs/01194.wav|What is or was your treatment?
wavs/02605.wav|I have to. Look, she's leaving.
wavs/04521.wav|I think our fellows are asleep. Curses on them both!
wavs/06202.wav|Then I have given my own judgment on every point.
wavs/04161.wav|Yet unjust she might have been; and this thought to me was the greatest torment.
wavs/01845.wav|You're gonna leave your shoes out here?
wavs/05522.wav|Marius stiffened himself in advance.
wavs/06114.wav|I am glad you're well.
wavs/00388.wav|When did you have the last symptoms?
wavs/04301.wav|The two children idly followed her to the house.
wavs/00023.wav|Since when have you had skin symptoms?
wavs/05407.wav|Not open to every man.
wavs/04552.wav|In the mean time, you understand what you are wanted to do here?
wavs/05455.wav|Tell me if I am likely to seduce any one.
wavs/02637.wav|Any condition affecting your thyroid?
wavs/02118.wav|I'm not sure I know what you're getting at. Would things have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
wavs/04200.wav|Same as the dry iodine alone. I reckon you will.
wavs/04688.wav|But what are you going to do in the morning?
wavs/01281.wav|You're doing this amazing independent thing.
wavs/04795.wav|Ach, what a foolish talk! Ain't it? Tomorrow, my lord.
wavs/03929.wav|Love was to me, as to him that made me, all in all!
wavs/02339.wav|I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
wavs/04758.wav|None of the party could distinguish firm ground from bog.
wavs/02991.wav|right here, right now, what would you say?
wavs/04137.wav|I've got to hoe, and I'll hoe it till I drop right here.
wavs/05806.wav|He has been in hiding for ten years.
wavs/03019.wav|I hate when my father calls me that.
wavs/06230.wav|I please not her. Heavens, that I were a lord!
wavs/00801.wav|Why don't the four of us have dinner tonight? As friends.
wavs/03222.wav|See how he was sweating when he walked out? If I'm hogging the ball too much, you jump right in there
wavs/03954.wav|Why there and not here?
wavs/03352.wav|Oh, by the way, Harry, I had a letter from Captain Poland today.
wavs/02050.wav|Please. I don't!
wavs/04937.wav|Away, captains!
wavs/01704.wav|What type of racing car do you drive?
wavs/03324.wav|I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing. Your friends are just looking out after you.
wavs/01953.wav|Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I hope she throws up on you.
wavs/02794.wav|He's walking around all the time, dragging his hands.
wavs/01988.wav|Oh hey
wavs/00070.wav|It's an emergency. But you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
wavs/02613.wav|Are you awaiting an operation for this condition?
wavs/05291.wav|The thing has shrunk. Oh, you'll make me love you!
wavs/03558.wav|The night test. As you till yesterday did, nor tell her TRULY your wishes?
wavs/06489.wav|I insisted on going back with him to our hotel.
wavs/00886.wav|At what age did you suffer from your disorder the first time?
wavs/04644.wav|It was all so natural that any one would have been taken in.
wavs/02997.wav|Up until tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too.
wavs/04424.wav|I am not at all used to speeches of this sort.
wavs/04511.wav|Never mind all that! His love is for our Lady and the saints.
wavs/05278.wav|So you don't believe in Art for Art's sake, Paul?
wavs/04782.wav|Her temper was open. Socrates now resumes the argument.
wavs/06831.wav|The sun hurried round to the north, sinking closer to the horizon. In a constitutional king it is what infidelity is in a wife: it is adultery.
wavs/00045.wav|You're a shoe!
wavs/05431.wav|He furnished this chamber with a multitude of elegant trifles.
wavs/05458.wav|A revolutionary tribunal was created.
wavs/03647.wav|Nothing but fair is that which you inherit. Heat.
wavs/05948.wav|Even Agnes could, on rare occasions, be angry.
wavs/00433.wav|A wandering?
wavs/04007.wav|Faltering and undecided still, the Jew went on.
wavs/04245.wav|By a GUST of wind in the night?
wavs/01130.wav|On what other basis was the insurance sum calculated?
wavs/01348.wav|I can't drink this now. I'm gonna go change. I've got a date.
wavs/04460.wav|I am not that man.
wavs/02183.wav|What races or events do you participate in? Please indicate the amounts of the last years and the planned amounts for the current year.
wavs/00480.wav|Hi! Yes you said that.
wavs/02802.wav|There's no way to tell you this.
wavs/03394.wav|It's not my line. These are now our only provisions.
wavs/05441.wav|Better than everything; better than all the world, darling?
wavs/04264.wav|You are out of order. To none of THEM, however, is Wilde indebted.
wavs/03722.wav|The sun is sinking and it is nearly eight o'clock.
wavs/03076.wav|Hating this. That's nice. Get out!
wavs/01729.wav|See! Great story. But I gotta go.
wavs/05874.wav|The very thought appalled her.
wavs/04716.wav|Or would you like another?
wavs/00858.wav|You what?
wavs/05583.wav|O peer!
wavs/02485.wav|Yeah that's true.
wavs/03232.wav|Oh no! I I can't drink this now!
wavs/06273.wav|I knew what you were going to say.
wavs/00261.wav|I don't know. What are you wearing? Why would you want to operate a drill press?
wavs/06119.wav|Now, how did ice do this? I sent an excuse.
wavs/06211.wav|Maybe it was the buggy he was after!
wavs/05870.wav|Anne is in the library.
wavs/04190.wav|Always handsome!
wavs/04951.wav|Conception.
wavs/02034.wav|Just like you told her you did.
wavs/00810.wav|What? I said What? I said
wavs/00542.wav|Ma's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know.
wavs/05155.wav|I feel no anger against her now; it has burned itself all away.
wavs/03918.wav|I am mad at BEING obliged to admit it.
wavs/00062.wav|You're so funny! He's really funny!
wavs/06070.wav|Tennis is a game of intimate personal relation.
wavs/02512.wav|How much alcohol do you drink?
wavs/05646.wav|And what you are smothering me for, I cannot think.
wavs/01662.wav|I guess. Are you sure? Carol!
wavs/04601.wav|What is your object in wishing me to do this? You here again?
wavs/01072.wav|No, no, no. No resentment. Believe me
wavs/02302.wav|He's really funny.
wavs/01177.wav|Do you also dive in off-shore areas?
wavs/00161.wav|Why waste your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead. 
wavs/01477.wav|Mine. I wrote a note to myself, then I didn't need it.
wavs/03897.wav|That was a good haul, he said, better THAN average.
wavs/01255.wav|So. Just us. I have enjoyed the fact
wavs/02740.wav|Which of the following activities do you participate in?
wavs/02542.wav|there isn't anything I can't do. That does not sound stupid to me.
wavs/01075.wav|You. Really?
wavs/04861.wav|Miserable aristocrat!
wavs/03503.wav|She was still unable to believe wholly in the supernatural.
wavs/02890.wav|So, will you invite us to the big opening? You got any tweezers? I think I have a rogue hair.
wavs/05546.wav|But that window is closed.
wavs/04353.wav|But what length of time?
wavs/02980.wav|What a beautiful story. I'm fine by the way.
wavs/00367.wav|We're just gonna need a little time.
wavs/04029.wav|And there the colonel threw in his bait and waited.
wavs/01747.wav|And did you notice? Yeah.
wavs/01242.wav|I've got an idea. Dinner.
wavs/06020.wav|Many have glimpses of "that something," but few ever reach the state where the mind is steady enough to fathom these depths.
wavs/02030.wav|Did anybody else feel like peeling their skin off
wavs/02666.wav|I said that a little too loudly, didn't I? You had what?
wavs/01376.wav|No actually
wavs/05381.wav|Tis a great charge to come under one BODY'S hand.
wavs/01362.wav|He's been more loving. It's like every day is our anniversary.
wavs/06711.wav|And it may be so under certain conditions.
wavs/01656.wav|Oh I'm on! I'm sorry he's in a meeting right now.
wavs/01925.wav|That'd be cool!
wavs/00319.wav|Oh, my God, I'm late! Oh, no, no, no. Don't go, don't go. Okay, okay.
wavs/02811.wav|When did you undergo the therapy?
wavs/00328.wav|Lose the other guys.
wavs/06533.wav|When she sees this, what does she do?
wavs/01489.wav|She'd feel like we're ganging up on her.
wavs/02445.wav|you might be.
wavs/01394.wav|So why didn't you say anything?
wavs/03483.wav|Well, I wondered if I could do that; it seemed rather a feat, you see.
wavs/03867.wav|Let those who doubt it, turn their eyes on the republic of Venice.
wavs/02196.wav|I think he's across the hall.
wavs/05476.wav|And yet you couldn't fence him away from the girls with barbed wire.
wavs/01543.wav|You weren't there.
wavs/01290.wav|There's only one way to resolve this. You know, I don't see that happening.
wavs/04793.wav|The work of hands not pledged to grind or slay.
wavs/02949.wav|So he's going out with her. Is it really so terrible? He's falling in love with her. You won't lose him.
wavs/01270.wav|Is any further surgery or corneal laser planned?
wavs/01553.wav|Like in a cab Save it!
wavs/00124.wav|And he has your number? This is so fun! What do we do now?
wavs/02796.wav|Do you still have symptoms or complaints?
wavs/02176.wav|Then we Then we got dressed and I walked her to
wavs/00085.wav|What other activity do you take part in?
wavs/05470.wav|Toward midnight a black, staggering body of men began to weave through the entrance.
wavs/01156.wav|What type of diabetes do you have?
wavs/04189.wav|He uttered a cry of hope: had a friendly hand shot it? Please receive her, and she will tell you some new things. Come in, Jacob.
wavs/03134.wav|How deep do you usually dive?
wavs/01375.wav|I'm happy for you? Well don't be!
wavs/02164.wav|What is your current occupation?
wavs/01616.wav|I don't know. It's weird.
wavs/05714.wav|My brethren, THESE things ought not so to be.
wavs/05521.wav|How beautiful they are! I studied him attentively: I tried to read his character in his face.
wavs/05565.wav|Yes, I must, I must!
wavs/03910.wav|But I don't think I'm tall enough for it.
wavs/05527.wav|In the first place the Acropolis was not as now.
wavs/02625.wav|about making things right? Things were fine this way!
wavs/01133.wav|What medications did you take?
wavs/04886.wav|Then Grandpa announced that the PICTURES were over.
wavs/01475.wav|In case of emergency call?
wavs/00171.wav|What other racing car do yo drive?
wavs/06350.wav|What refuge was now left to me? Yes, sir, the Avenger!
wavs/05951.wav|Romeo.
wavs/01777.wav|We were just. What?
wavs/05038.wav|He kept his direction in line with a western star.
wavs/03747.wav|But she must make it clear that there could never be anything more.
wavs/00052.wav|Did you see her?
wavs/01441.wav|All right, I'll catch up with you later. No.
wavs/01481.wav|You feel complete.
wavs/02062.wav|Can I tell you what the answer is? Hey, you're single. Have some hormones.
wavs/03293.wav|What kind of treatment are you undergoing?
wavs/01800.wav|Any condition affecting the kidneys, bladder or prostate, for example protein in the urine, kidney or bladder stones?
wavs/04101.wav|And he remained there MANY days. The incline widened.
wavs/02042.wav|After all your years of struggling
wavs/05347.wav|So that the day the noble may attain.
wavs/01622.wav|What. What were you thinking?
wavs/01386.wav|and breaks that measuring device.
wavs/00237.wav|Which professional education do you have?
wavs/05693.wav|You were nicely screwed yesterday. A purely mythical prisoner.
wavs/04054.wav|Well, Sir.
wavs/02887.wav|Oh do I? You had what?
wavs/03087.wav|What? You slept with Jason? You had already broken up. How long? Just a couple hours.
wavs/05262.wav|Antoine came.
wavs/02166.wav|Is the tumour located in the brain?
wavs/04322.wav|We shall have leisure to think of retirement afterwards.
wavs/05377.wav|"This is the first time since I have been here," said he, "that any one has entered here."
wavs/00864.wav|I miss you too.
wavs/05514.wav|Book land was called such because this holding was written down in books.
wavs/01840.wav|Yeah. He could row like a viking. So how'd it go?
wavs/04912.wav|Her little Lena drown herself!
wavs/01877.wav|I shouldn't have to feel
wavs/06794.wav|The sources of evil in the latter are confined to her own limits.
wavs/06699.wav|Come inside at once, you naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp.
wavs/01547.wav|what the hell are you saying?
wavs/03234.wav|I think you'd remember that. Yes.
wavs/05859.wav|She is the biggest drawing card in the tennis world.
wavs/03893.wav|I am glad of that.
wavs/06640.wav|Once I was deaf, my children, but now I hear.
wavs/04440.wav|I would correct him. Her parent is Religion; her sisters, Patience and Hope.
wavs/00024.wav|Do you suffer from breathing problems?
wavs/03822.wav|When one's knowledge is exhaustive, one comes to other conclusions.
wavs/00709.wav|I could really
wavs/02461.wav|How many do or did you smoke?
wavs/03278.wav|Is there somebody else?
wavs/02601.wav|Are you free of symptoms and free of treatment?
wavs/02343.wav|Did you ever attempt suicide?
wavs/04938.wav|Here he again demanded my reasons for wishing to go.
wavs/03644.wav|From her no help was to be expected.
wavs/05090.wav|Yes, about eight. You have heard of a Miss Durham?
wavs/02533.wav|And a third for your
wavs/04496.wav|I only want distraction. The Major shook his head.
wavs/06043.wav|A woman of the world?
wavs/06487.wav|Will you stand in a white sheet by the grave?
wavs/04978.wav|"Madame," said he, in an imperious tone, "your husband must be persuaded to go to bed at once."
wavs/04608.wav|May you, honourable lady, be long enabled to say, Blessed be his name!
wavs/01923.wav|The point is that
wavs/05724.wav|Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
wavs/03931.wav|He subscribed for several papers, and read and digested them carefully.
wavs/04840.wav|Beside his bulk Henri looked slim as a reed.
wavs/00658.wav|Please specify your consequences or symptoms and or or the ongoing treatment
wavs/02783.wav|Are your joints deformed?
wavs/04446.wav|It can't!
wavs/03730.wav|A good musician. These ladies all hoped to succeed to the Imperial Highness.
wavs/01037.wav|That was amazing! I can't even send back soup. Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle.
wavs/01243.wav|I know she's gone, but I just don't feel. Maybe she's not really gone.
wavs/00048.wav|What other ulcer do you have?
wavs/04255.wav|You shall not go. The doctors gave me up.
wavs/03112.wav|How long are you in the city? Two days. I got a job.
wavs/04472.wav|And whatsoever shall be left until the third day, you shall burn with fire.
wavs/00502.wav|Everybody I love is in the same room. I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun dried tomato business.
wavs/06507.wav|I said I would wait.
wavs/04028.wav|Judge of my prudence by my long delay.
wavs/00839.wav|you're gonna live by my rules. Wow he's strict.
wavs/04828.wav|Why didn't she die when she was about it?
wavs/06766.wav|From first to last it was full of disappointment.
wavs/05207.wav|Let me, therefore, make one more sacrifice for your happiness.
wavs/04911.wav|In the neighborhood of the observatory I took lodgings.
wavs/00369.wav|Which other races do you participate in?
wavs/05354.wav|But to me alone was the nature and seat of the disorder known.
wavs/03697.wav|The darkness was more profound than ever, but its very depth reassured him.
wavs/06235.wav|He will follow us anon.
wavs/06108.wav|At the same time he approved of his having remained on his property.
wavs/03754.wav|This speech was woman all the world over, of every age and every land.
wavs/06710.wav|Billy whispered. And I did not lose all of it. Never mind: these urchins must be my Works of Art.
wavs/02129.wav|Come on. This is us. I'm not. This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job.
wavs/04582.wav|This is more simple in its construction, while it has certainty in action.
wavs/04523.wav|He would complain to the landlady, he would.
wavs/02727.wav|It's perfect. We'll put it between lunch and breakfast.
wavs/01910.wav|What type of anaemia have you been diagnosed with?
wavs/04603.wav|Well, your old vice still: mistake the word. My first impulse was to ride for the river nine miles away.
wavs/02530.wav|Okay you guys want anything else?
wavs/00635.wav|Why
wavs/01230.wav|How often does your allergy occur?
wavs/00449.wav|Did he mention us? He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
wavs/03965.wav|One man indeed stood out at even a superficial glance.
wavs/01982.wav|At which side do you wear the hearing device?
wavs/05581.wav|So I don't believe I owe dad a cent, when it's all figured out.
wavs/00998.wav|How is your visual impairment currently corrected right eye
wavs/06434.wav|Why, if they ain't right warm! Her husband?
wavs/00064.wav|I've had it with you and your cancer
wavs/01608.wav|Does anyone want the rest of this Pop Tart?
wavs/00334.wav|What are you, crazy? That's a baby!
wavs/05430.wav|But why do you not give me another word?
wavs/05060.wav|The staircase of the Acropolis had sixty steps.
wavs/00263.wav|You have given me so much.
wavs/03172.wav|How often do you have symptoms?
wavs/00806.wav|I did the windows. I did the floors.
wavs/01756.wav|Who's to say what's true?
wavs/00605.wav|Well maybe it's cold in there.
wavs/02167.wav|Me neither. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.
wavs/01530.wav|There it is!
wavs/03995.wav|The negative sign was repeated. Said he didn't want to know and didn't care.
wavs/05853.wav|Next day, we anchored, it being most clear and beautiful.
wavs/04790.wav|They journeyed on, and the child played beside them, but heavily, more heavily.
wavs/03764.wav|It comes naturally, sir. Good sir, speak it to us.
wavs/00657.wav|Do you still have symptoms or complaints due to your disorder?
wavs/00303.wav|Hey, hey, hey! That's not the rule, and you know it!
wavs/04140.wav|The fall was PERILOUS. He stopped and looked at me.
wavs/05672.wav|This last I said with a thrill; truly, I was gripping hold of the vernacular.
wavs/01759.wav|You slept with her for seven years after that.
wavs/01653.wav|But it happened to me. What am I doing?
wavs/05258.wav|Myles would have given much to know his thoughts. Hail, most royal sir!
wavs/05214.wav|Railroads? Indeed, it seemed that the girl loved him.
wavs/02207.wav|Roger's having a dinner thing. He wanted me to invite you guys. So, what's going on? Nothing.
wavs/04284.wav|I closed my eyes. This then must for every reason be our road.
wavs/04898.wav|Our heiress!
wavs/01515.wav|How often did you dive during the last three years?
wavs/00053.wav|Okay and the robe is lost.
wavs/06478.wav|The French boy knew no more about the stolen envelope than I did.
wavs/04025.wav|What say you to the day? Only let her come in!
wavs/02654.wav|They do? But they're not your friends anymore.
wavs/03280.wav|in high school. What we did was wrong.
wavs/02977.wav|Do you currently suffer from any symptoms?
wavs/00652.wav|for a large portion of the day. I could do that.
wavs/03968.wav|And Absalom made a feast as it were the feast of a king.
wavs/05222.wav|I said taking off my cap. Am I the man still?
wavs/05256.wav|Who is the first that doth prefer himself?
wavs/03731.wav|Do you not believe, therefore, that your child and grandchild will be kings?
wavs/06073.wav|I have seen some people.
wavs/04701.wav|Grace passed on, and sunk down on the first seat she could reach.
wavs/00522.wav|Have you been out of work for more than two weeks in the last five years due to this disorder?
wavs/06721.wav|And he shall be vested with the linen robe and the holy vestments.
wavs/01961.wav|Oh, so you're divorced? No.
wavs/01115.wav|Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
wavs/01160.wav|Please give details of the results
wavs/02815.wav|I'm sorry. God, I am so sorry! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much.
wavs/03163.wav|Come on
wavs/00212.wav|Oh no! Don't ever do that! What? I'm sorry.
wavs/00357.wav|Does he know? Who?
wavs/04713.wav|I studied him attentively: I tried to read his character in his face.
wavs/00349.wav|He's not gonna hurt them, right? Do you always have to bring him? I didn't wanna leave him alone. We had our first fight this morning.
wavs/00257.wav|You're kidding.
wavs/03603.wav|But it was no good. He did not care. Ah, you are joking, Monsieur!
wavs/01322.wav|I think some things are better left unsaid.
wavs/02600.wav|Which medication are you taking?
wavs/05605.wav|I was more than ready to meet him half way.
wavs/01015.wav|You could do that. You think? Absolutely!
wavs/00815.wav|Well.
wavs/00084.wav|How often do you use explosives?
wavs/03385.wav|We must press on at all costs! No explanation followed.
wavs/06566.wav|They are very simple and easy of construction.
wavs/02078.wav|at the little theater in the park?
wavs/04262.wav|In any case, here we are upon the road: the die is cast. Why did I not die!
wavs/00931.wav|I better go. I'll miss the train. I don't want you taking that thing. Where do I stay? Here?
wavs/03632.wav|The mistake had been slight. O no, I don't want to go back!
wavs/00884.wav|It's just You know, they're parents.
wavs/01774.wav|Unless What? Unless you wanna stay over.
wavs/03608.wav|This was information, indeed! Now into camp filed a small procession: four women, four children, and two young men.
wavs/06492.wav|A very good omen! I've heard lots about you.
wavs/01103.wav|You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not.
wavs/00021.wav|Hello? Yes, she is. Hold on a second please. Hello.
wavs/03267.wav|now I'm happy.
wavs/02422.wav|once I got on the subway right? And it was at night
wavs/03744.wav|But why did not you look for the steps? Little Lucy looked frightened.
wavs/02484.wav|You think? That's so nice.
wavs/01369.wav|Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
wavs/00843.wav|Yes you said that. Yes! Yes, I did. But what I didn't say
wavs/02964.wav|That was amazing! I can't even send back soup.
wavs/04466.wav|Letters of his to Charles Francis Adams had appeared in print.
wavs/06416.wav|What could he be looking for on that immense expanse?
wavs/00460.wav|and he has a real job. I go on three auditions a month and say I'm an actor, but he's
wavs/02409.wav|How was I supposed to know
wavs/06356.wav|They were savages, yes; but the savages of civilization. And what is the true derivation?
wavs/06801.wav|Seemed to want to come.
wavs/05164.wav|I laughed and waved my hand to her.
wavs/00699.wav|Water's working. And action!
wavs/05821.wav|It was written by Miss Pink. Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock him.
wavs/00856.wav|Whose ball of paper is this?
wavs/05513.wav|Ain't one bed enough for the two of you?
wavs/03440.wav|The stiffness hovers over me yet; exercise is beneficial.
wavs/06321.wav|The young baron saw that sudden color. The sky had seemed low that night.
wavs/02515.wav|But if you have to ask. Thank you.
wavs/04208.wav|How did you deduce the select? And why don't you try striped wall paper?
wavs/04500.wav|A piece of raw silk fresh from the worm.
wavs/01600.wav|What? I thought we were trying to find stuff.
wavs/06226.wav|The portrait of the Deity!
wavs/00066.wav|How has the mole been removed?
wavs/04971.wav|It's time to order now.
wavs/05708.wav|The other little ones were timid and blundering. Henri stared up at the sky.
wavs/00515.wav|What's wrong, sweetie? Nothing.
wavs/04217.wav|And go to him by yourself, if he does grant it?
wavs/03346.wav|It's absurd to say she caught it with us.
wavs/03714.wav|The poor Prisoners in the Luxembourg hear the rumour; tremble for a new September.
wavs/04991.wav|She had recovered. Now it showed this subterranean hall in which we stood.
wavs/06071.wav|You know my position here. Farewell, brave foe!
wavs/05452.wav|This brought forth another oath. He passed on regretfully.
wavs/03623.wav|It is the picture of my pet kitten.
wavs/00911.wav|So what is it about me? Yeah right!
wavs/01439.wav|and she's perfectly nice but that
wavs/01416.wav|I just don't feel the thing. 
wavs/04527.wav|Bring Reynolds down here to look after the work until I'm around again. Dreadful?
wavs/02845.wav|All you need is a woman who likes men, and you'll be set. Not her.
wavs/04072.wav|The sea is the vast reservoir of Nature.
wavs/00703.wav|We got a bookcase. It's beautiful. What's this?
wavs/01323.wav|To what extent are other persons liable for the loan?
wavs/05659.wav|Mr. Travers, completely convinced by the statement, made no sound.
wavs/02961.wav|How many attacks did you have in the last five years?
wavs/01576.wav|You know, I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me.
wavs/02180.wav|Thank you. That's not really the point.
wavs/06734.wav|It's SUCH a dismal day.
wavs/00976.wav|That's not all.
wavs/04748.wav|I answer, they are unlike.
wavs/04961.wav|"Well, I vow," said the mother, "if I ever heard anything like it!"
wavs/01116.wav|You don't know? She seems nice, but her coming all the way here
wavs/04455.wav|Why should I hide it?
wavs/03174.wav|if I kept it it would be like stealing. Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
wavs/02656.wav|Are there any special skills required for your occupation?
wavs/02367.wav|What? Relax your hand. Let your wrist go.
wavs/06465.wav|Sister saw to that. He hardly knew himself how it had come about.
wavs/04621.wav|You must miss him. That's the way with everybody.
wavs/01205.wav|Where are you accommodated?
wavs/03021.wav|He's right. Enough. What's the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time.
wavs/00243.wav|Since when? Since always. It's like dating language.
wavs/00423.wav|It was better than the troll thing. At least you got to see my head.
wavs/01105.wav|It's just you know what?
wavs/05001.wav|Magdalen says it soothes her feelings and clears her mind.
wavs/04113.wav|Don't ask me now. But their attempts were vain.
wavs/05301.wav|The family has not increased greatly in the new country.
wavs/01943.wav|I can't believe you
wavs/06008.wav|O gods, he dare not! Her favorite son, too.
wavs/02676.wav|But I'm not. Yep. Pretty much. You're a lucky man.
wavs/05990.wav|The laws. Illness kept them now at Venice.
wavs/02369.wav|I'm fine, I'm fine. All right.
wavs/01609.wav|Has the inflammation resolved without any further symptoms?
wavs/03138.wav|How often did your symptoms occur in the last ten years?
wavs/01605.wav|Do you have symptoms of pain and impaired range of movement?
wavs/04094.wav|The noise of weeping was heard from some of those who surrounded Baxter.
wavs/02394.wav|Come on. I'll show you to my room. This is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.
wavs/01830.wav|Each period of complaints lasted for
wavs/06371.wav|The most died in their duty. Will you sell now for ten shillings?
wavs/04406.wav|You needn't be troubled about me any more.
wavs/02004.wav|Feel better. We're gonna be late, sweetie.
wavs/02724.wav|because he got a restraining order.
wavs/05791.wav|Eugenie, what have you done with your gold?
wavs/04719.wav|The meal was finished in a constrained silence.
wavs/04395.wav|To run from me and his boy without a word!
wavs/03880.wav|But a woman did cast him in my teeth this day.
wavs/06228.wav|I saw them pass the window just now.
wavs/04038.wav|And of old times I thought, that now were grey.
wavs/05632.wav|And they adored the Lord there. The Captain understood her.
wavs/00445.wav|What bank is this? Okay it's him.
wavs/00719.wav|We're very excited about it. Thanks. But I'm just going to hang out here.
wavs/00973.wav|He says he's really gonna miss you guys. Rough day huh?
wavs/03708.wav|Was his engagement to Lucy an ENGAGEMENT of the heart?
wavs/00197.wav|Hold on a second!
wavs/00418.wav|Oh so this does work. Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
wavs/02829.wav|Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
wavs/05193.wav|His evasive reply was affirmative enough. One characteristic example is Vesuvius.
wavs/06519.wav|He thrust out his hands in the darkness.
wavs/01567.wav|Who? Pete the Weeper.
wavs/06372.wav|What, sweetheart, afraid to confide your sorrows to me?
wavs/00736.wav|What treatment have you received?
wavs/06342.wav|The literary quality of it did not appeal to me.
wavs/03749.wav|Then I suppose he got tired of you and ran away.
wavs/04063.wav|Randal tried to reconcile her to her own happy ignorance.
wavs/02950.wav|Oh sure it is!
wavs/06657.wav|He operated.
wavs/04981.wav|It will soon give way to some other whim.
wavs/04120.wav|She could not comprehend the strife of the women over the one man.
wavs/00547.wav|During the last five years have you been unable to work?
wavs/03785.wav|I have bought fifty dollars worth of silver.
wavs/00571.wav|Good boy. See? How can nobody want him? Somebody will.
wavs/06148.wav|I must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can.
wavs/04956.wav|Or does my sight Deceive me in the uncertain light?
wavs/02634.wav|But there's something.
wavs/05119.wav|Why, no; the day had broke Before we parted.
wavs/04458.wav|May, with orders to carry it into effect with the least practicable delay.
wavs/01962.wav|Thank you. Thank you. Here. Go with the egg my friend.
wavs/02863.wav|I know. But we're not. Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
wavs/01796.wav|I can't believe what I'm hearing. Can't believe what I'm hearing
wavs/05827.wav|From the capitol to the prison is a walk of but a few minutes.
wavs/06574.wav|There were several scattering votes.
wavs/06329.wav|We WERE not an intrusion.
wavs/03279.wav|It's not mine. If I kept it, it would be like stealing.
wavs/06563.wav|It seems to work perfectly.
wavs/03654.wav|And besides, it might seem a little significant.
wavs/00734.wav|How do you fit into this whole thing?
wavs/01994.wav|Do you still suffer from any complaints or symptoms?
wavs/01598.wav|Honey, tell them the story about your patient
wavs/00151.wav|Please specify your complications and symptoms
wavs/02055.wav|Sorry the swallowing slowed me down.
wavs/00046.wav|Call me if you change your mind.
wavs/00210.wav|You're right. It is.
wavs/06559.wav|He's retired to his mine with a revolver.
wavs/02270.wav|I'm very aware of my tongue. Come on.
wavs/05967.wav|He made an appointment with me for this morning.
wavs/05964.wav|Kings and priests are very much where you left them.
wavs/06080.wav|That all the houses in the haven rang.
wavs/03350.wav|Tell me what you propose. Who can wonder!
wavs/00298.wav|Let's go away this weekend.
wavs/03951.wav|Suddenly, a rending and rushing sound burst from the cave.
wavs/06667.wav|The bolt!
wavs/03022.wav|Can't we have what we have now? Up until tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too.
wavs/03554.wav|He spared no possible means of reducing his enemy to submission.
wavs/02439.wav|No, I figured that's where you'd be. Hell is filled with people like you.
wavs/02126.wav|it freaked you out?
wavs/04809.wav|"And I don't see that I can be of any service," added Ned, "so I'm off to my work."
wavs/02555.wav|How often per year do your activities include other types of explosions?
wavs/02738.wav|Have you ever exceeded the radiation limit?
wavs/01959.wav|Will you undergo surgery?
wavs/06246.wav|Marius waited for them all day in vain.
wavs/01274.wav|Which surgery was performed for laser
wavs/06786.wav|There are instincts for all the encounters of life. I know his kind.
wavs/04822.wav|Not so with the woman who assisted Mohammed.
wavs/06231.wav|A second moan brought her to the landing near his room.
wavs/06769.wav|Half of the success of your play was due to her.
wavs/03275.wav|We won!
wavs/05340.wav|It is already on the green table of the Bourse.
wavs/00090.wav|Today's the day Carol and I first
wavs/00311.wav|And what would my opening line be?
wavs/01069.wav|Yeah, check it. Definitely gonna want some of that! You don't have insurance?
wavs/04371.wav|But what has the dear little thing done?
wavs/04023.wav|Hun!
wavs/05619.wav|His manner betrayed not the slightest interest or pleasure.
wavs/06810.wav|Discloses, reveals to sight. I can see them now.
wavs/01834.wav|How often did or do your symptoms occur?
wavs/03353.wav|An endowment twice as large as ours would be unavailing. List!
wavs/03454.wav|Then follows the religious ceremony. The snipe showed themselves in numbers.
wavs/01724.wav|Have you been admitted to hospital for more than three days regarding to your allergy to drugs?
wavs/04126.wav|The talk was friendly, everything had been friendly each day.
wavs/05450.wav|Desire, which usually sets free the tongue, only petrified his powers of speech.
wavs/05266.wav|Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
wavs/02776.wav|Hold on. You knew?
wavs/03761.wav|It brought forth six creations: Adam, Eve, cattle, reptiles, the beasts of the FIELD, and demons.
wavs/06328.wav|This is a good place!
wavs/06795.wav|There are two theories on the subject of land now abroad, and in contention; both false.
wavs/01036.wav|When did you lose both feet?
wavs/05614.wav|Moreover, he might answer shortly and simply, but he makes an enormous circuit.
wavs/04269.wav|Yes, and couldn't afford to pay for Sam's education.
wavs/02245.wav|Yeah I guess.
wavs/05749.wav|And he did so, and went naked, and barefoot.
wavs/02719.wav|How old was she there?
wavs/03047.wav|Everybody knows this?
wavs/03311.wav|No, because this line is passion, and this is just a line.
wavs/00081.wav|Never had that one. All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
wavs/04658.wav|Let's make a rush for it, then. He couldn't tell.
wavs/06498.wav|We SHALL sleep if we can do so.
wavs/00616.wav|See what he does? He knows no one's gonna say all those names.
wavs/04948.wav|Well, now, I tell you what you do.
wavs/03309.wav|Do you suffer complaints, limitations or disturbances in movements?
wavs/03393.wav|The first are PRISONERS, but the latter traitors.
wavs/00698.wav|Really? Sorry.
wavs/03809.wav|I cannot tell, but they are both gone together.
wavs/05831.wav|I am the only one that runs any risk at all.
wavs/04155.wav|The term "unit of work" means a measurement, or a factor which may be used to measure force.
wavs/04328.wav|May Heaven grant me kinder eyes than I have now.
wavs/01858.wav|Look at them. Look at how happy they are.
wavs/02611.wav|I don't know. You just You have a quality. Yes exactly.
wavs/06652.wav|This is but a custom in your tongue; you BEAR a graver purpose, I hope.
wavs/00286.wav|We're with you. We got it. I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be like this giant karmic debt.
wavs/01009.wav|What type of motorcycle sport do you practice?
wavs/00602.wav|And action! And cut!
wavs/00869.wav|How can I leave you? I just found you.
wavs/05608.wav|It is a matter for study for some years before beginning the work.
wavs/04399.wav|He is a true friend.
wavs/03003.wav|Finally, I figure I'd better answer it.
wavs/00044.wav|Oh my God! You gotta come see this.
wavs/04587.wav|His voice sank away INTO nothing, and his beard drooped upon his breast.
wavs/05096.wav|They plunged in the river, and swam to the raft.
wavs/05704.wav|Bert cried.
wavs/01108.wav|It's hard that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
wavs/01381.wav|We ordered a fat free crust with extra cheese!
wavs/01989.wav|I could do that. Okay, then you let me go grocery shopping
wavs/05518.wav|One face which should have been there was wanting.
wavs/00552.wav|So at least I'll get to see him again.
wavs/03711.wav|I know well that men must talk, and I will be very good.
wavs/06504.wav|My father.
wavs/02583.wav|Yeah alright.
wavs/06497.wav|He bewitched her. Yes, you only think of yourself!
wavs/02871.wav|What is your annual income?
wavs/00686.wav|Look I.
wavs/05463.wav|My best ideas have come to me out of doors.
wavs/01673.wav|Do you work with
wavs/05517.wav|Clayton caught the boy's eyes on him, and a half smile on his face.
wavs/00817.wav|Do you still suffer from symptoms?
wavs/01338.wav|I mean why should I let them meet him?
wavs/06644.wav|By the dread archangel given.
wavs/04268.wav|I did not know you had that gun.
wavs/03105.wav|Did you suffer more than once from your complaints?
wavs/03381.wav|We have one enemy the less. A friend from Ireland!
wavs/02710.wav|Everybody, I would like to get this in one take. Let's roll it.
wavs/04849.wav|Nay, she is sometimes tortured by convulsions. It don't pay.
wavs/03705.wav|I hear so much apprehension that Germany won't be punished sufficiently for her crime.
wavs/04124.wav|You will find this habit of relaxing is very good.
wavs/02573.wav|How you get any work done is beyond me. I don't get how guys can do so many mean things
wavs/03568.wav|Sir, I cannot. Then we can soon suck his brains?
wavs/01176.wav|All right you madcap gal! Try to imagine this.
wavs/01053.wav|He is? And way out of your league.
wavs/04870.wav|It was not that which was troubling her.
wavs/00333.wav|If I turn into my parents, I'll be an alcoholic blond chasing men
wavs/03627.wav|And the meeting did happen, but in a formal way quite unexpected by her.
wavs/05709.wav|There was something hard but compelling about her blond beauty.
wavs/06495.wav|The doctor retired for the purpose of getting his electrical apparatus.
wavs/03367.wav|Before the time be out! They come as settlers, or even as single sages.
wavs/00788.wav|Excuse me that's my puck.
wavs/06806.wav|How I shall BUILD; how large to make the convent, And which way fronting.
wavs/05081.wav|Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.
wavs/03889.wav|"Then you are wrong, Master Land," I continued; "this low coast which rounds off to the south is the Egyptian coast."
wavs/03527.wav|That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
wavs/01523.wav|Hold on a second and let me just check and see if she's here. It's the woman from the hospital. There's a problem with the form.
wavs/04634.wav|Keep still, you LITTLE devil, or I'll cut your throat!
wavs/04428.wav|Are you quite comfortable? A prophecy of Christ.
wavs/00289.wav|Come on what do you say
wavs/05867.wav|Anne! They nodded, and Demeter on them gazed.
wavs/03354.wav|He looked about him, but saw no one.
wavs/01368.wav|That was like
wavs/01685.wav|Do you take part in National, European or World Championship competitions?
wavs/04247.wav|But I don't really like attending such people so WELL as the poor.
wavs/03260.wav|When did the disorder occur the first time?
wavs/06631.wav|That meeting was the real event of the evening.
wavs/04443.wav|What hath the Lord spoken?
wavs/03179.wav|Has the tumour been completely removed?
wavs/04725.wav|Oh, he has, has he?
wavs/00797.wav|One more and then I have to go. Cool.
wavs/03432.wav|How long you have stayed!
wavs/02904.wav|How long did your symptoms last?
wavs/03969.wav|See if you like: but don't get in the way. How do you know that, madam?
wavs/05854.wav|And Viola closely observed the conduct of the chauffeur.
wavs/00708.wav|No. No that's okay.
wavs/05178.wav|It's a quotation from Joseph Conrad about advertising.
wavs/01730.wav|You shouldnt be here. It's a school night! Oh God!
wavs/01107.wav|Do you compete in any competitions?
wavs/00227.wav|How often do you suffer from symptoms?
wavs/05181.wav|But the Englishman and the Colonial went to their tent, to lie down.
wavs/02721.wav|See? There you go. The cleansing worked.
wavs/06443.wav|Oh, women!
wavs/02154.wav|There's nothing to wonder about.
wavs/02408.wav|Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay? Okay. Okay. Keep the change.
wavs/00577.wav|What's going on? You have no idea how loud they are.
wavs/02130.wav|You have no idea.
wavs/00799.wav|I'm sorry
wavs/02228.wav|That I was not expecting.
wavs/00546.wav|So do we have the best friends, or what? I've always wanted to know.
wavs/03283.wav|Hey, hey, hey! Her stuff wasn't in it!
wavs/04838.wav|The King hath heard them; to the which as yet There is no answer made.
wavs/02824.wav|which is funny because that wasn't even my major. Now that is funny!
wavs/01294.wav|I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this? Does the knuckle cracking bother everybody?
wavs/04273.wav|Turned down at all the right places, aunt.
wavs/02290.wav|When has your physician diagnosed your disorder?
wavs/04694.wav|But it was not that which withheld me.
wavs/01874.wav|Look at the little thing! Who are those people?
wavs/02159.wav|Anything else I should know? Nope. That's it.
wavs/04422.wav|She was compelled to address herself to Horace once more.
wavs/01207.wav|When did you last see your doctor regarding your skin complaint?
wavs/02659.wav|It's just. I hate that guy!
wavs/00160.wav|or I'll end up like my mom! How's it going?
wavs/04733.wav|He made no answer. You have said the word.
wavs/03363.wav|Rachel agreed.
wavs/06571.wav|I pray your worship come a little nearer this ways.
wavs/06414.wav|You will see to it that they don't loaf.
wavs/00879.wav|This is the worst breakup in the history of the world! Oh my God!
wavs/01434.wav|Maybe it's a contest? Like Collect all five. 
wavs/02835.wav|Okay bye. Uh uh. Uh huh.
wavs/02072.wav|Where do you stay within the country?
wavs/01423.wav|No it wasn't. Then with authority hang up.
wavs/02444.wav|when it wasn't even me. What?
wavs/03798.wav|If it fails, it will be the most heroic failure in English history.
wavs/01938.wav|Sorry my thing was in there with me. How's it going? Good.
wavs/03703.wav|I was talking about Henrietta.
wavs/05740.wav|The fierce power of his personality seemed to have turned into a dream.
wavs/00603.wav|Oh I did know how to tell you.
wavs/03146.wav|Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with? Yeah!
wavs/05644.wav|Then Gerard appreciated the grim pleasantry of the unbending sire.
wavs/01507.wav|Come on, drop the towel. Drop it. Will you please drop it?
wavs/00946.wav|Oh come on
wavs/03826.wav|He shuddered at the very thought that this was possible.
wavs/04321.wav|No, it isn't either; I've just looked in the book.
wavs/03919.wav|Your whole mind became an unpleasant thing to contemplate.
wavs/05104.wav|Where is mother? He saved my child at sea.
wavs/04293.wav|I've been a good many years learning the business.
wavs/03614.wav|But there is no need further to multiply instances.
wavs/02065.wav|Okay you cannot do this to me. You're right. I'm sorry.
wavs/00868.wav|If you want I'll do it with you.
wavs/02452.wav|Me.
wavs/02559.wav|Really oh
wavs/05421.wav|I will sell you the green ones for three cents each.
wavs/02766.wav|You have an appointment to see a doctor or nurse for in next three weeks?
wavs/06042.wav|It reads quite like one of the old fairy stories, does it not?
wavs/06056.wav|How awful it seems! She seemed perfectly gentle and composed.
wavs/01094.wav|I mean, what the hell is that thing? I accept those flaws. Why can't you accept me for this?
wavs/06666.wav|Gentleness in passion! I grant; as there may between the lists and the velvet.
wavs/04457.wav|He, in one day, so to speak, ends it.
wavs/05411.wav|Poison her?
wavs/05067.wav|Carter did not know whether to smile or to look horrified.
wavs/01095.wav|Of course I knew. What do you think? You should have heard his cover stories.
wavs/01634.wav|Feel better okay? Thanks for everything Mon.
wavs/03426.wav|Quite strong enough, Norah. The commissioner betrayed a slight impatience.
wavs/03254.wav|Did you ever see Dead Poets Society?
wavs/02966.wav|I don't know. That's a little weird. It's vinyl.
wavs/03175.wav|I'm thinking. Thanks.
wavs/04535.wav|She goes on dreaming thus of the stars.
wavs/04109.wav|His eyes were still closed.
wavs/00705.wav|I didn't know you could dance! You were in a play! Come on, it wasn't that bad. I was the lead.
wavs/01956.wav|So guess what?
wavs/05719.wav|They had just discovered the mine and were returning toward camp.
wavs/04416.wav|She crossed the room and laid it upon a shelf.
wavs/01287.wav|Have you had any of the following complications?
wavs/01746.wav|But No but. You know that thing we put over here with the pin in it?
wavs/02033.wav|I wouldn't wanna be there when the laughter stops.
wavs/02382.wav|Nice shoes huh?
wavs/06508.wav|O lady, it is well. Why then, lead on.
wavs/03752.wav|Inscrutable, to the wisest, are these latter; not to be prophesied of, or understood.
wavs/02503.wav|You're gonna keep an eye on us? Right. As long as you are under my roof
wavs/06765.wav|You will miss her sorely. Let them die!
wavs/00121.wav|It's my bank. What did they do?
wavs/02551.wav|An added pinch of saffron makes all the difference.
wavs/06254.wav|The elms over there are full of robins.
wavs/04682.wav|I found that he still looked like Guru. I'm sure I beg pardon.
wavs/01677.wav|Since when do you dive?
wavs/01736.wav|Have you been unable to work due to this condition?
wavs/05073.wav|I turned toward home. We resumed our studies.
wavs/00693.wav|Come on you guys. Oh no
wavs/02595.wav|There!
wavs/05380.wav|That is the first point to clear up.
wavs/01701.wav|Oh, give me! Can you see me operating a drill press?
wavs/04084.wav|Then they continued their journey.
wavs/03932.wav|The evil of an entire race flowed in his veins.
wavs/02147.wav|It's just easier that way. You told me about the last dream.
wavs/01581.wav|Because I know that this isn't the end.
wavs/04707.wav|They were frozen with terror; they stood undecided.
wavs/05462.wav|He put out a strangely distorted talon and gripped my fingers.
wavs/00963.wav|Which type of trails do you take?
wavs/00309.wav|You did it twice? The first time didn't really count. You know, it was Barry.
wavs/02049.wav|Please specify the begin and end for this disorder
wavs/05830.wav|I caught at the second and opened it. I am very little hurt.
wavs/05680.wav|The Liberals will never make a count of you.
wavs/03411.wav|Nothing could equal his confusion. Nothing would change her.
wavs/03843.wav|I know it to be false. They think themselves, suddenly, amazingly.
wavs/06027.wav|This was not an absence, it was an exile.
wavs/01928.wav|Oh, I'm sorry. I gave you one job!
wavs/00032.wav|So are you gonna invite us all to the big opening? What do you think? Today's the big day!
wavs/02538.wav|And it was.
wavs/06661.wav|It is an infallible RECEIPT for tuning him.
wavs/02779.wav|You know what I like most about him, though? What?
wavs/06360.wav|This enabled him to look out by pressing his knees against the wall.
wavs/03292.wav|I hope it's okay.
wavs/03000.wav|What is or was your condition?
wavs/04736.wav|For all that we have decreed in your favour shall stand in force.
wavs/06323.wav|A period of absolute friendliness had ensued. Lo here my HAND on it!
wavs/05570.wav|They would take the conceit out of me.
wavs/04702.wav|Everything was so different from what she imagined it would be.
wavs/03819.wav|Please to reflect, and tell me your opinion.
wavs/02958.wav|Getting so good at that! I love this artichoke thing.
wavs/06677.wav|The Governess.
wavs/05466.wav|That's why you are sore at it. "So you do not want me to send the child home again," he asked, "you are not tired of having her here?"
wavs/03961.wav|"What does this letter mean," cried she warmly, "which I found in his pocket, six months ago?"
wavs/02259.wav|All right. I'm gonna push you, okay? How about I push you like this?
wavs/01147.wav|Now he's happy.
wavs/05065.wav|How it freshened the soul! Yes, it's a palace, it's a wonderful place.
wavs/06403.wav|You may well open your MOUTH, young man.
wavs/03035.wav|No no
wavs/03589.wav|I hope you feel better, sir, after your rest?
wavs/02181.wav|How often per year do your activities include above ground explosions?
wavs/04139.wav|Just you and I together!
wavs/04801.wav|If life is not always poetical, it is at least metrical.
wavs/03117.wav|Both of you?
wavs/00135.wav|Which one?
wavs/01516.wav|uh send our dog off to live on a farm.
wavs/04929.wav|I am leaving this part of the world altogether.
wavs/04142.wav|We must do something to keep the Marquis in Calais till tomorrow midday.
wavs/05209.wav|The unfortunate man rolled over the side of the raft and instantly disappeared.
wavs/01664.wav|who my parents preferred.
wavs/00114.wav|You can totally, totally live on this. Oh yeah. Yeah.
wavs/04211.wav|She had never known father or mother. Ah, now!
wavs/00392.wav|I mean, there's really no easy way to say this
wavs/06665.wav|And if he proceeded to ask, What other figures are there?
wavs/00645.wav|We checked.
wavs/01792.wav|But you know
wavs/02481.wav|That's nice. Now was that before or after you told him
wavs/02000.wav|I bring a guy home and they're all over him like
wavs/06803.wav|The men she had known had been small and dark.
wavs/01878.wav|What are we supposed to be seeing here?
wavs/00818.wav|Do you still have symptoms or sequelae from the disorder?
wavs/05703.wav|There's no more to tell. Herbert interrupted him again.
wavs/00586.wav|What treatment are you on?
wavs/02741.wav|Are you being followed up or are you currently on treatment?
wavs/05219.wav|Yes, my dear, if the weather is fine.
wavs/04282.wav|"Very well," said Fisher, in a louder and more cheerful tone; "let us all have the benefit of it."
wavs/02257.wav|Which side of the body was involved?
wavs/04754.wav|What, girl!
wavs/03987.wav|Patty watched the parson turn leaf after leaf until the final one was reached.
wavs/03189.wav|How many benign tumours are there?
wavs/05083.wav|"Rob," said Neil, almost in a whisper, "we've got them!"
wavs/05702.wav|She put them behind her.
wavs/01166.wav|Really? Just casually strewn about
wavs/06022.wav|For him, for her husband, it was easier, anyway.
wavs/06186.wav|She was coming my WAY. Go up boldly and say I sent you.
wavs/00026.wav|When did you last have a blood test?
wavs/03508.wav|The wonder is the world is as good as it is.
wavs/06188.wav|When the worms come out then the blackbirds feed.
wavs/03791.wav|I like you! John Hammond. I have the right to SOME repose now.
wavs/02101.wav|I can't go when I'm nervous. I'm sorry you're right.
wavs/02580.wav|Okay insurance?
wavs/04412.wav|The head was not veiled. Now I admire you.
wavs/02360.wav|they're not love.
wavs/05201.wav|She commanded herself SUFFICIENTLY to offer a regretful hand.
wavs/02177.wav|Don't ever tell me what you did in there.
wavs/03648.wav|There's something here beyond me.
wavs/01167.wav|In which age has the osteoporosis been diagnosed?
wavs/03928.wav|I'm going to put you two fellows up against.
wavs/01683.wav|When was the examination?
wavs/02366.wav|Then you put your arms around me. Oh, sorry. And then you tell me you love me and you'll never forget me.
wavs/02158.wav|What side of the body is involved?
wavs/03441.wav|She made me go there to my lunch.
wavs/06305.wav|While she had told him matters that concerned him he had listened eagerly.
wavs/01123.wav|When did the injury happen?
wavs/01957.wav|You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed! That's nice.
wavs/00504.wav|All right! I'm putting it out!
wavs/01110.wav|Yep. Pretty much. You're a lucky man.
wavs/00435.wav|She. Of course, she.
wavs/06454.wav|Yes, better than ever. What sacredness in that farewell!
wavs/03625.wav|Nay, keep your way, little gallant: you were wont to be a follower, but now you are a leader.
wavs/01670.wav|Oh, my life is just so amusing. Can we drop it now?
wavs/03772.wav|Creation employs all its critical faculty within its own sphere.
wavs/00051.wav|You won't know a butt if it bit you. There's an image.
wavs/05843.wav|She's wait for us. From hunger, cold, isolation, destitution.
wavs/05055.wav|You NEVER saw the like by day. "My place in the world," he answered, "is none to ask a woman to share."
wavs/01651.wav|Wow you remembered! Like the kind you
wavs/04229.wav|A wave of moral indignation swept over America.
wavs/03717.wav|It was my business to find out what it was.
wavs/04411.wav|Did she say nothing when she took the child away?
wavs/04509.wav|And what is the revolution that we shall cause?
wavs/02821.wav|Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand.
wavs/00240.wav|Yeah twin thing. I can't believe you did this.
wavs/00882.wav|I didn't know you could dance! You were in a play!
wavs/03660.wav|I don't know where you are coming from.
wavs/01062.wav|Please describe your restrictions in movement
wavs/03813.wav|Infirm of purpose! His MOTHER herself! We had to do a little planning.
wavs/06291.wav|They are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine.
wavs/00190.wav|Look honey
wavs/05099.wav|Mysterious vessel! We made one of these into which emptied a little river.
wavs/03621.wav|Awkward.
wavs/00134.wav|Which other type of aviation do you do?
wavs/02588.wav|My mom will.
wavs/06189.wav|Yes, aunt, why? Oh, good people, help me save him!
wavs/01951.wav|Did you ever have an accident when flying?
wavs/02511.wav|How often has the disorder occurred?
wavs/05699.wav|"You are looking at me," she said, "and wondering how I can be happy in my position?"
wavs/03313.wav|Oh God!
wavs/03486.wav|But you will buy my WARES? And she watched the fire flicker and fall.
wavs/04075.wav|In the city of sugar and tobacco, too, it was "Othello" which carried off the palm. These pilgrims Montana Kid proceeded to farm.
wavs/01258.wav|Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
wavs/03814.wav|But TIMON had not; and he did not only owe money for food.
wavs/01285.wav|Are there special safety regulations for your occupation?
wavs/00893.wav|I don't wanna do that. That's not good.
wavs/06245.wav|They turned and rode off in a furious passion.
wavs/00793.wav|No but
wavs/05731.wav|Clara figuratively, absolutely perhaps, on her knees, he would raise her and forgive her.
wavs/03759.wav|The vision smiled, kept still, and looked beyond him. How could she resist.
wavs/04774.wav|Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!
wavs/03990.wav|My pen is naught; gentlemen, lend me a knife.
wavs/04964.wav|We are going to America to make more.
wavs/03317.wav|What medical treatment has been recommended or carried out?
wavs/01873.wav|Was it good for you? I win! I win!
wavs/02768.wav|I'm looking. I'm looking.
wavs/00155.wav|I'll be right back. This is so much fun!
wavs/00917.wav|A half charred picture of.
wavs/06627.wav|Alas, the way is wearisome and long. Folly!
wavs/04326.wav|Wonderful boy? I ask for your consent upon my knees: a daughter can humiliate herself before her father.
wavs/04704.wav|He moved to the edge of the table as though to intercept her.
wavs/04568.wav|Was I not in possession of his ladder? So I would!
wavs/00725.wav|How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail.
wavs/04851.wav|We had in deed "struck," to use a sea EXPRESSION, but in an inverse sense, and at a thousand feet deep. Dreams of the summer night!
wavs/05994.wav|It was DRIZZLING still, so I lay under the wagon on the mud.
wavs/05253.wav|It will be of far wider scope, and will touch on almost all questions.
wavs/05516.wav|Malicious tongues Are ever busy with your name.
wavs/01633.wav|That's great! What's the part?
wavs/00500.wav|Where are or were your varicose veins located?
wavs/05026.wav|They in turn hate and persecute us for vile heretics.
wavs/01827.wav|Those earrings look really lovely on you.
wavs/05375.wav|When, uncle?
wavs/01057.wav|I've been trying to call you. Listen.
wavs/00938.wav|Please indicate the reason for the osteoporosis
wavs/01132.wav|You brought your kids. Yeah. That's okay, right? Party! That thing is not coming in here!
wavs/01355.wav|Before we get into any staying over stuff
wavs/00933.wav|And I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel.
wavs/04479.wav|But where was the money to come from, to pay for my commission?
wavs/04238.wav|The place, of course, was in an uproar; women fainting and shrieking, and men rushing in.
wavs/06024.wav|I will follow you in a QUARTER of an hour.
wavs/03334.wav|And with that I took my departure. But it is capable of much more.
wavs/00827.wav|How young is young Ethan? Young?
wavs/02882.wav|feel the thing. If that's how you feel about the guy, dump him.
wavs/05319.wav|A gross case of bullying.
wavs/02041.wav|Have you had surgery for this condition?
wavs/05660.wav|Denys burst in, and there was Gerard asleep.
wavs/02963.wav|I'd have said, Get out of my office! 
wavs/00863.wav|What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. It's an expression. No, it's not.
wavs/02086.wav|we can break them up. I'm sorry. I can't believe I did this.
wavs/04930.wav|So, watching and waiting, Venters let the time wear away.
wavs/02374.wav|sweep everything off the table.
wavs/04705.wav|I suppose I could use my own submarine.
wavs/05695.wav|But now that he is dead, why SHOULD I fast?
wavs/00666.wav|What complications do you suffer from?
wavs/03485.wav|There is.
wavs/04403.wav|Why, she has owed me four hundred and eighty francs for two years.
wavs/06610.wav|But in his barn with hens and hay, Or mending harness, cart, or sled?
wavs/06088.wav|My husband and my lord, my LORD and husband; I am your wife in all obedience.
wavs/06775.wav|He bent and kissed the tips of her fingers reverently.
wavs/04254.wav|We'll have to go into it soon enough. I was saying nothing, Captain.
wavs/05800.wav|The women were not without modesty, nor the men without a pale chivalry.
wavs/05586.wav|He laughed in my face.
wavs/00507.wav|When you're holding it you feel right.
wavs/00895.wav|It's Phoebe. And Rog!
wavs/06736.wav|Any other man would have taken off the blister. Where are you going?
wavs/06162.wav|It seemed to him that he no longer dared.
wavs/01190.wav|Thanks, Chandler. Get off!
wavs/04855.wav|Who would go about to rob any one of such a thing as that?
wavs/01542.wav|but remember, there's also a lot to learn. Marcel this is for you.
wavs/03082.wav|Yeah. Yeah it is. You'd go out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
wavs/02327.wav|Oh look. It's the woman we ordered. Hey can we help you?
wavs/02952.wav|What were the results of the examination?
wavs/01135.wav|Please specify your disorder
wavs/05903.wav|I'll tell you presently. Soon the girls would begin their tennis parties again.
wavs/00165.wav|Please describe your symptoms and or or complications
wavs/06678.wav|Somehow, I fancied I felt some one near.
wavs/00428.wav|But you'll live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die. That was really good!
wavs/00941.wav|You left your hair at my place. I thought you'd need it for your meeting.
wavs/04818.wav|I want your opinion. "Good," he said to himself, "those unhappy girls dropped it."
wavs/00921.wav|She's this high powered, driven, career type. Identical? People say we look alike.
wavs/05006.wav|Some of the strongest characteristics of my life were awakened in my childhood.
wavs/01781.wav|Alan. He was unbelievable! It was like he made us into a team.
wavs/03692.wav|And your mother, too, is the mother of all?
wavs/03048.wav|I can't believe I forgot a magazine. Come on, this might be good. I don't know.
wavs/04586.wav|Tell me; can you? But the link between was missing.
wavs/04096.wav|Daughters, Willoughby, daughters! You see, we are at the village now.
wavs/02778.wav|You don't understand. Yeah right!
wavs/02015.wav|Please select your hazardous duties
wavs/02458.wav|What are or were your symptoms?
wavs/01240.wav|No, I'm fine. See ya. I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was,
wavs/05031.wav|Needless to say her critic is a woman.
wavs/04296.wav|What does Mrs. Rook matter?
wavs/00742.wav|Oh my! Thanks.
wavs/06193.wav|I have sworn that you shall live a virtuous life; expect, therefore, many troubles.
wavs/02342.wav|Please specify your complaints
wavs/03579.wav|Not understand me! And your cheeks are red with blushes!
wavs/05558.wav|But this is not enough.
wavs/02303.wav|So this time I won't quit.
wavs/02098.wav|Do you still have sequelae caused by the poisoning?
wavs/01333.wav|Oh, God! I'll be right there, Bernice. Look please don't go anywhere.
wavs/04475.wav|More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
wavs/05590.wav|They were probably sold at auction and he bought them.
wavs/03168.wav|You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it.
wavs/05412.wav|She ran her fingers through her loosened hair for a while.
wavs/05793.wav|Let me notice one by way of illustration.
wavs/05341.wav|The sounds were heard in the other shops, and men came running out.
wavs/01794.wav|about making things right? Things were fine the way they were!
wavs/00169.wav|we've done some excellent work here. And I would have to say
wavs/04280.wav|White Man, step to starboard.
wavs/05324.wav|They saw fit to leave their home and their delicate mother.
wavs/04868.wav|This woman would not yield to gentler measures; harder must have their turn.
wavs/05927.wav|And I also BEHELD twelve others following him.
wavs/01829.wav|I don't know. You don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're crazy!
wavs/03493.wav|In his opinion the Tsar should be omnipotent.
wavs/03371.wav|Hardest work in the world to get him away.
wavs/04355.wav|Be gone; we shall be robbed by and by.
wavs/02712.wav|Well, we rarely have to return from a fire as quickly.
wavs/02636.wav|When did you start having symptoms with your skin?
wavs/03204.wav|You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
wavs/05602.wav|They all noticed another change in this variable young person.
wavs/04656.wav|"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you not come at once?"
wavs/05767.wav|I am confident that they cannot deny this.
wavs/04205.wav|The reconciled Assembly will not advise; will not interfere.
wavs/05814.wav|Presently their path was again intersected with other little tortuous paths.
wavs/01753.wav|Here we go. Come on. I'm sorry! Oh, my God! That's it!
wavs/06212.wav|And Fred was certainly very fond of his mother.
wavs/06068.wav|Well, then, keep up a good heart, mother.
wavs/00872.wav|What is the nature of your martial arts activity?
wavs/01444.wav|Are you okay? It's just my lens. It's my lens.
wavs/04544.wav|At Florence!
wavs/02954.wav|A whole other machine for your colors.
wavs/00266.wav|Really? We played, watched TV. That juggling thing is amazing.
wavs/01372.wav|I hate that guy! What? So he was a little analytical. That's what he does.
wavs/04539.wav|It was as much as I could do to assent.
wavs/05842.wav|This became my wonder now, while she slowly drew on the second glove.
wavs/04760.wav|Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.
wavs/06077.wav|Already he thrilled with a sense of POWER and prosperity.
wavs/01939.wav|How long will you be staying there?
wavs/02216.wav|Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing.
wavs/02508.wav|I'm out of here.
wavs/00592.wav|The way he makes me feel about myself. Yeah
wavs/04222.wav|The thousands of women that were weeping through his fault!
wavs/03080.wav|Date night! Saturday night. Saturday night!
wavs/02521.wav|I know. One day he's this little thing
wavs/06200.wav|The body shuddered. I have not lost a moment, however.
wavs/06422.wav|She has been so nice!
wavs/01549.wav|Look what I got going. Save it for the cab.
wavs/01934.wav|It's gonna be an open casket, you know?
wavs/06689.wav|I hope we shall have no more such close calls.
wavs/02565.wav|But he's just phoning it in.
wavs/02411.wav|Fine. Now you'll never know. We're kidding. Tell us.
wavs/01014.wav|How much time do you spend on the following activities
wavs/00768.wav|We should really be sitting for this. Sure we should.
wavs/03890.wav|Clara has been dreaming about you; and Clara is foolish enough to believe in dreams.
wavs/03892.wav|And you see! Do REFLECT that Celeste will probably have five hundred thousand francs.
wavs/03682.wav|Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.
wavs/01436.wav|I had a dream that I was playing football with my kid.
wavs/01357.wav|Your grandmother would've hated this.
wavs/00280.wav|That's ridiculous.
wavs/02199.wav|Are there any limitations included?
wavs/01652.wav|What's wrong? Come on. It's nothing. I'm fine.
wavs/02047.wav|that I'm going out with more people than she is.
wavs/00724.wav|I better pass on the game.
wavs/05173.wav|Also Bella.
wavs/05662.wav|Auntie has thought of sending you your hat and coat.
wavs/02765.wav|Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping. Say I bought a great pair of shoes.
wavs/02266.wav|and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed.
wavs/02843.wav|Don't you realise what you're you're doing to yourself?
wavs/02593.wav|What were you thinking?
wavs/04960.wav|As for entirely hiding that I had used my eyes, I can't say: they must answer for it.
wavs/02700.wav|During that second time, you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup! You did it twice?
wavs/03841.wav|I saw you come out and sit down here.
wavs/01660.wav|And cut! What was that? I was going for quiet desperation.
wavs/04307.wav|Philippe talked about things in general, with perfect propriety.
wavs/04279.wav|You've got time to lie down about ten minutes.
wavs/01492.wav|Why is this girl going to call me?
wavs/02597.wav|I know you did, cookie. I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
wavs/01904.wav|How long do the symptoms last?
wavs/03613.wav|She was a kindly woman, and she had ached with pity.
wavs/02169.wav|I'm not at all surprised about that. That's why you're so great. Which has nothing to do with it. I found out today.
wavs/05625.wav|I suppose he has not gone away with anyone?
wavs/05351.wav|For I certainly know that face, that look, that expression.
wavs/06580.wav|Experience teaches more than inspiration. "This is my favorite walk," she said, simply, "since I have been in Edinburgh." Be yourself, and think of nothing but me.
wavs/00194.wav|So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
wavs/04056.wav|And now you'd better go. I long to see.
wavs/00766.wav|You gotta do it man.
wavs/02246.wav|Not so much.
wavs/01907.wav|Now wait a second.
wavs/05557.wav|Under suspicion?
wavs/02870.wav|We just feel that he's.
wavs/04836.wav|The inevitable inquiries and explanations followed. This, however, looked like preparation.
wavs/01065.wav|But it's not gonna work. If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
wavs/01995.wav|Sorry
wavs/03356.wav|Amanda Gill had reached it.
wavs/05169.wav|We only reached our moorings two hours since.
wavs/04753.wav|I also undertook to procure. Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the way home again.
wavs/03224.wav|What are you talking about? Don't feel bad.
wavs/03097.wav|When have you been diagnosed the first time for this condition?
wavs/06818.wav|We were flat. I suppose I do. He had the drop on him.
wavs/05547.wav|This hint had a magical effect on the ushers and the young lawyer.
wavs/02819.wav|We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.
wavs/05062.wav|It is the same thing, my dear monsieur.
wavs/02448.wav|No problem. I'm not done yet. Why would someone do that?
wavs/05654.wav|You aren't afraid to ride in THAT, are you?
wavs/03349.wav|There is a comfortable sofa. What difference would it make?
wavs/05755.wav|She was that sort. THEN there ensued a subdued wrangle in the yard.
wavs/05481.wav|He drained his glass. I will give you some friendly advice.
wavs/01535.wav|there's something you should know.
wavs/04244.wav|The big sorrel could not be gotten into Surprise Valley.
wavs/00989.wav|No that was clenching.
wavs/00526.wav|It was comfortable and it was familiar.
wavs/02299.wav|I'm really not.
wavs/05394.wav|There were more than a hundred pieces, and every one of them gold.
wavs/02179.wav|Everybody, this is Danielle. Danielle, everybody. Why are you here?
wavs/00932.wav|You finally get up the courage to do it. There's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
wavs/03609.wav|Nay, speak no more now. These damned civilians!
wavs/06154.wav|Blaine.
wavs/05254.wav|And smashed the conventions of Society whenever you saw fit.
wavs/02478.wav|David's, like, a scientist guy. He's very methodical.
wavs/03884.wav|Ay, for the partridge, mother! Bless your honor!
wavs/04389.wav|Was it respect? The answer would cover all the grades.
wavs/02052.wav|I'll go see. This almost never happens.
wavs/01199.wav|Yeah, I know. I'm just not that bright either.
wavs/00037.wav|When were your last symptoms of this disorder?
wavs/04647.wav|The great thing is that the discovery is made.
wavs/01966.wav|What does Bob look like? Is he tall, short? Yep.
wavs/06134.wav|I have no prospects of money from my own family. So I is! The Spirit and the Bride say: Come!
wavs/02920.wav|What is the difference in leg length?
wavs/06255.wav|Those poor creatures! And that one can well understand.
wavs/02368.wav|Do you see anybody you think could be me?
wavs/06159.wav|The man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings.
wavs/04878.wav|He drew his hand back as though to throw the volume at them.
wavs/02419.wav|Please state your unearned income of the last three years, property rental income, dividend from shares, interests or other
wavs/05669.wav|At the door he turned.
wavs/04303.wav|With that they will sleep warmly; not so bad.
wavs/02040.wav|Okay, windows are clean. Candles are lit. Am I out of control?
wavs/01031.wav|It's totally up to me. She is so great. I miss her. What does she mean by involved? Your job is done.
wavs/01635.wav|They don't see all the good and sweet stuff.
wavs/00671.wav|we didn't mean but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. You know I feel like I've lost her.
wavs/03214.wav|I get this feeling that she's, like, right here, you know?
wavs/00681.wav|using a bunch of these little worm guys.
wavs/02442.wav|So I went another way.
wavs/01692.wav|Do you want my tinfoil hat? No, you need that. It's okay. Thanks.
wavs/03056.wav|Can you believe this happened? No, no!
wavs/01568.wav|Ethan?
wavs/03624.wav|Her EYES fell upon two open letters. It's evening.
wavs/01896.wav|That's one way of doing it. I went for the watch.
wavs/00670.wav|How'd it go? Excellent!
wavs/01577.wav|Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye bye.
wavs/03521.wav|What is the young man's own account of the matter?
wavs/01184.wav|I just did what I thought you'd want.
wavs/06146.wav|She reiterated the WORDS with a low cry of pain.
wavs/00068.wav|Please give details of any other treatment
wavs/02113.wav|Try not to let my vulnerability become a factor here. Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime?
wavs/00075.wav|When was the therapy?
wavs/03680.wav|This charming woman, who chose to be known as Mme.
wavs/03141.wav|That's nice twice.
wavs/04817.wav|She would not let him know her terror of blindness.
wavs/06021.wav|Suddenly David's pose deserted him. There's our team ready.
wavs/00314.wav|I wanted this to work so much. I'm still in there.
wavs/04369.wav|Rare. He was a fool, For he would needs be virtuous.
wavs/04069.wav|Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
wavs/06826.wav|I suppose that I must obey, for you are master.
wavs/05611.wav|Take advantage of your social maiden fame to walk alone and grasp honors.
wavs/03246.wav|This was Carol's favorite beer.
wavs/03408.wav|His manner of greeting the priest was absolutely servile. What got he by that?
wavs/02013.wav|When did the surgery take place?
wavs/01603.wav|A lot.
wavs/06098.wav|The patriotism of the Irish had taken a peculiar direction.
wavs/02283.wav|Did you change your occupation for medical reason in the last five years?
wavs/05633.wav|I never saw such a kitchen in all my life.
wavs/03296.wav|And I'm getting coffee. And it's not even for me! If that sounds like I'm okay, then tell them I'm okay. Okay?
wavs/06691.wav|One for me. We are riddles to ourselves.
wavs/05427.wav|Promises under oath were not recognized for married women.
wavs/06527.wav|When it was over he took me by the hand, and thanked me.
wavs/03686.wav|You can go and look at it if you like.
wavs/06225.wav|The choice rests with me: suffer or enjoy.
wavs/06788.wav|I burst out laughing. Twas the deed of a mad woman.
wavs/02311.wav|and thank you for giving it to me. Thank you for giving it back.
wavs/06636.wav|Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it.
wavs/04110.wav|It is droll, though, how inattentive these journalists are!
wavs/04578.wav|It is difficult for most people to grasp the idea.
wavs/00947.wav|You barge in here and you don't knock?
wavs/00245.wav|Oh, come on. Okay. Well.
wavs/03237.wav|Hold on, camper. You've thought this through? It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
wavs/01013.wav|Oh, don't be mad. You didn't.
wavs/04242.wav|But I can't give her up. He did tell me.
wavs/05433.wav|Every one in camp also leaped to his feet, taking up the cry.
wavs/06749.wav|The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated it.
wavs/01663.wav|I never really noticed. Oh yeah
wavs/02996.wav|What do you mean?
wavs/00894.wav|Oh gosh. I love you.
wavs/00360.wav|Please provide further details regarding your medication
wavs/00380.wav|Well there you go. Stop it stop it
wavs/05908.wav|Surely you don't want money!
wavs/03549.wav|This reconciled couple desired only to be alone.
wavs/03207.wav|It's not even worth
wavs/04600.wav|I have found out who my patron is.
wavs/06397.wav|It arrived, not on plates, but in paper parcels.
wavs/01214.wav|But I'm not gonna do that. Okay everybody ready?
wavs/05751.wav|I am the most severely disciplined person in the world.
wavs/03046.wav|But you got promoted, and now you're
wavs/03865.wav|New fashion just come in?
wavs/01163.wav|At which age did the disorder first occur?
wavs/04213.wav|Maybe I have. They entered and groped their way cautiously along the sides.
wavs/06177.wav|Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not. Do you say no?
wavs/01308.wav|Really? He looks so tiny.
wavs/01798.wav|I really believe big things are gonna happen for you. I do. You've gotta keep thinking about the day that some kid will go
wavs/05472.wav|The blessed Sabbath! And only he? Contradict nothing he says.
wavs/02722.wav|No suds no Excuse me.
wavs/04146.wav|He goes?
wavs/02732.wav|It's a song.
wavs/06250.wav|I'll go to him and ask him to release you.
wavs/01377.wav|He finally asked you out? Yes! That'd be good.
wavs/03786.wav|I SAID I was innocent, then, for I had not eaten any chestnuts.
wavs/01345.wav|There you go.
wavs/00301.wav|Ooh I'm alive with pleasure now. Hey I might!
wavs/05978.wav|You then served idols that were no gods.
wavs/03184.wav|All right! All right!
wavs/04240.wav|Henry motioned toward the seat opposite the panel.
wavs/04973.wav|Rebecca scrambled up, trembling and pale with excitement. How, fair matrons!
wavs/03629.wav|How long HAVE you worked at umbrella covering?
wavs/05917.wav|The shadowy being finds its voice, and speaks first.
wavs/05965.wav|She raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it.
wavs/02191.wav|I'm sorry. I'm free! I'm free!
wavs/01879.wav|Whenever. She is a kook.
wavs/04501.wav|She stopped, and cast a helpless GLANCE at him.
wavs/00997.wav|Morning. We ready to go? It's stuff like that isn't it?
wavs/01022.wav|I don't think that was my point! Know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody?
wavs/04806.wav|She was in tears, and she was afraid to let him see it.
wavs/01932.wav|And this is my reward! Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
wavs/03637.wav|I have paid my debt to my host.
wavs/06455.wav|I am Rama, the last incarnation of Vishnu.
wavs/03567.wav|And I must have explanations on this point.
wavs/02751.wav|What? What were you thinking?
wavs/05987.wav|Assuredly not, he said; I have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning.
wavs/06602.wav|Be very sure that he does not think I do!
wavs/00148.wav|Why do they have to become people? Why do they have? Why
wavs/00159.wav|Your insurance will cover that.
wavs/04652.wav|There was some rain at times, but not enough to impede seriously our progress.
wavs/02021.wav|I met somebody who would be perfect for you. You see perfect might be a problem.
wavs/05440.wav|"Before we go," suggested Ned, "let's go take a look at that island from which Tom blew the top."
wavs/06825.wav|I felt complete. He had given all he had.
wavs/03075.wav|She was a big girl!
wavs/02649.wav|Are you free of symptoms?
wavs/02971.wav|It's gonna be really hard.
wavs/04955.wav|I've learned to make doughnuts.
wavs/00447.wav|with someone who is critical of every single thing you say? I can imagine.
wavs/00732.wav|I'm on this field, and they hike me the baby.
wavs/01511.wav|How old is that sock?
wavs/04698.wav|I've got half a notion to light out in the morning before day.
wavs/03635.wav|Yes, Socrates; and therein you do well, and I hope that you will remain.
wavs/03724.wav|"No," agreed Tom, "it was mostly smoke in there, and smoke won't melt tin." And then the absolute freedom from care!
wavs/00924.wav|No. You sure? Nobody
wavs/01408.wav|Do you travel in your country related to your activity?
wavs/01643.wav|Tell me something, what does no date pact mean to you?
wavs/06425.wav|He is a most charming YOUNG man. Is it not as I said?
wavs/06151.wav|Your offering? If you say the word, voila!
wavs/03173.wav|Okay, go into the bathroom. Use whatever you want. Just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
wavs/03372.wav|A door opened onto the deck and threw out a ray of light.
wavs/03382.wav|I shall not trouble you any more, Miss Morse.
wavs/02861.wav|Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days, then
wavs/03375.wav|My regard for my own interests supplied me with a subject.
wavs/01462.wav|You, by the door, in or out? ln.
wavs/04915.wav|I had never been in such a place before.
wavs/03475.wav|Then she put a hand on his arm.
wavs/03945.wav|But I wonder if she would care to?
wavs/02808.wav|You have not changed.
wavs/02633.wav|you know, things change. People change. We didn't change.
wavs/02747.wav|None of the bullets hit the engine, so we made it to the border. But just barely and I.
wavs/04548.wav|Then with that extraordinary hopping movement of his ran off across the mud.
wavs/05687.wav|And king Alexander gathered together a great army, and moved his camp near to DEMETRIUS. "Yes," conceded Tom, "you have." Then the allusion to Mary perturbed the sailor.
wavs/03942.wav|In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
wavs/03794.wav|But none of these people loved the Spaniards.
wavs/01100.wav|In the last five years have you been unable to work for more than two weeks due to this disorder?
wavs/05486.wav|The story made its impression, and Lapham saw it.
wavs/04333.wav|Suppose I write the LETTER first, and then we can have the duet.
wavs/04893.wav|And now join them, and let the three grow into one. The silence continued.
wavs/05331.wav|We will give one specimen, and one only.
wavs/06345.wav|She wanted to stop it, but she did not know what to do.
wavs/05734.wav|Now the Lord of peace himself give you everlasting peace in every place.
wavs/06514.wav|And what is it when we have it?
wavs/01973.wav|God help us. What? Look I'm asking a favor here.
wavs/01051.wav|You got it.
wavs/03716.wav|Leaving the boat, they plunged into the forest and tramped for some distance.
wavs/01195.wav|I turned it off. Just like you told her you did.
wavs/05766.wav|What did they say to each other? You have heard that phrase before.
wavs/02298.wav|Guess who's doing laundry there too?
wavs/06413.wav|I implore the tribunal to attach no importance to what my sister says.
wavs/02832.wav|You could be one of those guys.
wavs/06064.wav|I can't bear this! Have not you any new novels?
wavs/03316.wav|You know, they used to Like you a Lot.
wavs/01942.wav|I don't know. We still care about each other. Please! If she said to you, Ross, I want you on this couch
wavs/01465.wav|Come on, you came through. You did what you had to do. That's very dad. 
wavs/03570.wav|Hypocrite!
wavs/03038.wav|Has the pain extended to the lumbar spine or lower back?
wavs/06704.wav|Never mind the gunboats. I expect I shall catch it!
wavs/04018.wav|Am I the man still? Arabian medicine had certain very definite characteristics: the basis was Greek, derived from translations of the works of Hippocrates and Galen.
wavs/01871.wav|What joints do you have symptoms in?
wavs/02351.wav|What other treatment did you have?
wavs/05685.wav|You can do nothing until we hear from the solicitor.
wavs/05542.wav|If it sees the hunter, it is likely to charge him at once.
wavs/06486.wav|The disorders in the university do not concern merely the students.
wavs/01676.wav|You know, I don't see that happening.
wavs/03243.wav|Good for me!
wavs/03386.wav|I hope?
wavs/05599.wav|Forgive my weaknesses. Just look at this absurdity!
wavs/04940.wav|She blushed and looked uneasy, but made no reply.
wavs/00279.wav|Well you know
wavs/05889.wav|The grasses therefore reproduced themselves also after their kinds.
wavs/05414.wav|They are not really such a phlegmatic race, the English.
wavs/05812.wav|Thus to provide! She did not understand his meaning.
wavs/01498.wav|I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one, there was no answer.
wavs/03511.wav|Did you lay your hand on MERCY Merrick?
wavs/01614.wav|Let's see. Well it looks good there too.
wavs/02326.wav|Sorry. I gotta go.
wavs/00876.wav|What percentage is being bought?
wavs/06115.wav|The result was inevitable. By degrees I won his confidence.
wavs/06630.wav|I want to murder you. Well, now, and Miss Dale.
wavs/03741.wav|Because I know that he must come. The West always called its children.
wavs/00889.wav|Please specify your complications
wavs/02999.wav|Have you ever been in hospital with this disorder?
wavs/00665.wav|No I'm Oh. Thanks.
wavs/01908.wav|in a few years, we'll turn into them. Oh please!
wavs/02718.wav|Are you awaiting the results of or due to undergo any investigations?
wavs/02550.wav|You're nice Oh God. Okay. Bye bye.
wavs/03128.wav|to be the positive, life affirming person she is. That is a wonder!
wavs/04166.wav|Seeking a fight with me! "In all Bosnia," he answered gloomily, "there was only one such flower and that I stole."
wavs/03858.wav|And it would never do for the literary.
wavs/05150.wav|His own father had won the right of freedom of speech.
wavs/00312.wav|and I buy laundry detergent.
wavs/03661.wav|They had belonged to Nimrod.
wavs/00167.wav|You look good. You don't say.
wavs/04967.wav|"Well, anyhow," said he, braced and recovered, "it couldn't have happened anywhere but in little old New York."
wavs/05236.wav|And I could not put the horses in PRIVATE rooms.
wavs/01070.wav|Hi! Remember us? Well, it turns out we need a whole new one.
wavs/04982.wav|We saw two venture from the wood and draw it up on beach.
wavs/00845.wav|But it was different with him today. I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?

wavs/04341.wav|She has LIVED in a house all her life and knows about furnishing.
wavs/04261.wav|Doctor Colman thought the air would do him good.
wavs/03245.wav|I was going for quiet desperation.
wavs/06074.wav|Lincoln could not have proposed Union without requiring emancipation, also.
wavs/01892.wav|In a relationship, you have moments you'll remember the rest of your life.
wavs/01669.wav|All right. Name
wavs/06755.wav|Will you do me the honor of dancing with me?
wavs/00760.wav|We could be ourselves. We didn't have to play games. Have you called her?
wavs/06295.wav|Again, there is the sophistry of classes and professions.
wavs/02646.wav|Only child right?
wavs/04869.wav|William, the son, was a small man, WITH round features and dark hair.
wavs/03414.wav|Would it be safe for Tom to go?
wavs/03845.wav|In six years only nine copies had been sold! Alban still defended Emily.
wavs/06654.wav|Read the will! We are assured of it.
wavs/03849.wav|When the time was come, they were brought before their enemies and arraigned.
wavs/00249.wav|Yeah you do.
wavs/06361.wav|We'll see that everybody lets this thing alone.
wavs/01211.wav|And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
wavs/05976.wav|"Oh, yes," replied the other aloud; "there's a fireplace and a chimney in the office just by the door."
wavs/00189.wav|What is the total value of the company?
wavs/05024.wav|I thought he'd wronged you.
wavs/02145.wav|You're right, this wasn't worth it. Thank you.
wavs/03564.wav|If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad; That cures us both.
wavs/03073.wav|Please guys
wavs/03322.wav|Do you still have complications due to the disorder?
wavs/02221.wav|But I'm not gonna do that.
wavs/05742.wav|We are making a mess of it, it strikes me.
wavs/05730.wav|What do they say and what do they not say?
wavs/02869.wav|You're not him you're you. When they wanted you to go into your father's business, did you cave?
wavs/01733.wav|So like
wavs/02345.wav|I'm bing, bing, bing. You're boom, boom, boom. Oh my God!
wavs/03345.wav|From her dress, it was plain that she was a princess.
wavs/01661.wav|Do you know the causes for your disorder?
wavs/05030.wav|Enter Balthasar. A fire! The lines of battle were drawn.
wavs/04721.wav|Bud judged that cursing was his natural form of speech.
wavs/03967.wav|Alas, no! I know something of bad husbands.
wavs/06087.wav|I can see no more.
wavs/04663.wav|How are you and your swell friend making it?
wavs/01960.wav|But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.
wavs/00532.wav|No, you won't. No, we won't.
wavs/03052.wav|I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
wavs/02039.wav|Are you being followed up or receiving any treatment?
wavs/02695.wav|I'm spending most of my time teaching science
wavs/03909.wav|He made an EFFORT and stretched out on the bed.
wavs/00424.wav|to do on the plane.
wavs/02012.wav|Okay. It's it's about Alan. There's something that you should know.
wavs/02942.wav|That's tough tough stuff.
wavs/03030.wav|she makes when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel
wavs/02140.wav|Work people?
wavs/02222.wav|How'd that happen? My God! What?
wavs/03713.wav|What would your grace have done unto him now?
wavs/03447.wav|He therefore showed a calm, grave face when the spy returned to him.
wavs/01460.wav|Betty hi! You found Betty! Oh, my gosh! This is so great.
wavs/00749.wav|It doesn't mean
wavs/05496.wav|Well, then, look and speak.
wavs/06609.wav|The child entered the hut. No women had appeared.
wavs/05423.wav|There was nothing in the newspaper that he cared about.
wavs/06558.wav|There is a quicker way. Whose crafty head did all this?
wavs/03751.wav|Could I have sent you away? Yea; and paid me richly for the practice of it.
wavs/03212.wav|Oh God. Oh
wavs/04413.wav|He spoke in quite a friendly way, and, on reaching the landing, shook hands.
wavs/06548.wav|His recruits went on slowly.
wavs/06541.wav|He stooped for it hurriedly and lighted it, listening intently.
wavs/06248.wav|Nora fixed ACROSS the window.
wavs/03312.wav|Hey Dad. What's up?
wavs/04997.wav|Come on your ways: open your mouth; here is that which will give language to you, cat.
wavs/05950.wav|Now I am finding that I can enter them at will.
wavs/02320.wav|Is this, Like, I have an early class tomorrow
wavs/01524.wav|Man I'm talking loud!
wavs/04957.wav|Mirrored in its glassy surface appears everything around it.
wavs/04583.wav|And there came great fear upon all that heard it.
wavs/04985.wav|Let us this day terminate the long combat with error.
wavs/02173.wav|I won't talk to her. She obviously got my message
wavs/04556.wav|Nor did his words constitute a simple assertion.
wavs/00442.wav|All right. I know it's stupid. I'll see him this afternoon and put an end to it.
wavs/05580.wav|In Delaware, the chief executive magistrate is annually elected by the LEGISLATIVE department.
wavs/04451.wav|At the first floor up the young man paused.
wavs/05776.wav|Did you ever hear better?
wavs/01033.wav|When did you fist suffer from these symptoms?
wavs/02546.wav|No! Okay? She didn't know. How should I know?
wavs/03978.wav|Ain't I right, Saxon? He had no ambition; she supposed that was it.
wavs/03500.wav|What people?
wavs/05005.wav|The disturbing element had appeared.
wavs/06664.wav|Why, Jenny, I hope I shall still remain your friend.
wavs/04595.wav|They were both too hungry.
wavs/02921.wav|It was just nice.
wavs/05309.wav|We are in quite a different position now.
wavs/06366.wav|Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. He or she wrote to the publisher anonymously.
wavs/00177.wav|You know like a little fuzzy bear.
wavs/04351.wav|This time Magdalen turned on her impatiently. Chiding, scolding, rebuking.
wavs/00283.wav|What are your actual flight activities?
wavs/03369.wav|Even little boys, strange as it may SOUND, were given "Pamela" to read after the Bible.
wavs/01671.wav|Come on laugh. Laugh.
wavs/04078.wav|Forgive me for being gross, as you call it! Economy is not meanness.
wavs/05194.wav|Why should Greek disgust a democrat, when the very word democrat is Greek?
wavs/01300.wav|Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
wavs/05036.wav|I answer: If you deny that He is a condemned sinner, you are forced to deny that Christ died.
wavs/05233.wav|It is difficult enough to determine for the best.
wavs/02735.wav|Wait! I said maybe! Just breathe. That's it.
wavs/03238.wav|Pretty well actually. How come you have dental floss in your hair?
wavs/01224.wav|Has the tumour been excised completely and are you now fully recovered?
wavs/04794.wav|To her, probably, since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench.
wavs/04290.wav|I say that, if I were in your place, I would burn it.
wavs/02482.wav|How many beeps? She answered.
wavs/02210.wav|No don't touch that.
wavs/01790.wav|It's not that bad
wavs/00812.wav|Do you suffer from any other symptom or disorder such as
wavs/03114.wav|No, interestingly, her leaf blower picked up. So why didn't you say anything?
wavs/04039.wav|We'll be lucky if we don't get drenched.
wavs/04162.wav|How will you do? I am not related to them.
wavs/03304.wav|I was wondering about the mother to be, but thanks for sharing.
wavs/06050.wav|But Jude did not think of that, though she did.
wavs/02709.wav|I have another one for you.
wavs/00560.wav|Did you have gout attacks?
wavs/05129.wav|During the time Edward the Third did reign.
wavs/02487.wav|Listen I really wanted to thank you.
wavs/06605.wav|He had received the domestic education of a prince.
wavs/03151.wav|That wasn't easy but you did it. And I believe that when the right woman comes along
wavs/05770.wav|Dear flower of my life! A summer morning. She blushing!
wavs/05268.wav|Yes, I said; I know with my soul.
wavs/04560.wav|He wished he could stop there with this changing creature, descending no farther.
wavs/05191.wav|We met sword in hand.
wavs/01204.wav|What blood test has been carried out or being planned? (Please advise when and the result)?
wavs/01432.wav|Could I have? We're all out. Anybody else?
wavs/05543.wav|They reached it, and stood still. His left.
wavs/00125.wav|Not me. No, no, me neither.
wavs/05399.wav|There are many weapons that she could and does use.
wavs/01384.wav|Do you suffer from skin allergies?
wavs/00887.wav|Which side of your body is affected?
wavs/05807.wav|One of Young's Satires was then just published.
wavs/01591.wav|You wait until they send a notice. I could do that.
wavs/01649.wav|Don't worry about it. Apparently, other people have made the same mistake. So what do you think it is about me?
wavs/03868.wav|Sancho spoke.
wavs/01980.wav|Easy! Satan's minions at work again!
wavs/03677.wav|I see that you feast.
wavs/05410.wav|I felt somehow it would have been an easier job.
wavs/00952.wav|Which part of your body is affected?
wavs/02110.wav|It's a little more complicated
wavs/03877.wav|The immaculate one is there, and very fierce.
wavs/02975.wav|You got it! Bye everybody.
wavs/01810.wav|White House adviser, Clinton's campaign guy.
wavs/04706.wav|I have MORE than one hold upon them.
wavs/03988.wav|I to my master. It meant THAT she was vanquished.
wavs/05267.wav|Kiss me, sister, kiss me before I die!
wavs/03034.wav|Please state the name of your company.
wavs/03390.wav|Catherine said.
wavs/01361.wav|Well that's true.
wavs/01926.wav|Let it go. It's not a big deal. Not a big deal? It's amazing.
wavs/00307.wav|Um not so good. What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
wavs/06376.wav|We are bound to show a good deal of indulgence. I will be welcome then: conduct me thither.
wavs/00123.wav|What's going on? Nothing. I think it's nice when we're together.
wavs/05905.wav|But his assistants were running away, yelling with terror.
wavs/06184.wav|You will be able to lift nothing without anguish.
wavs/01786.wav|Do you still suffer from symptoms and or or consequences or are you still being treated by a physician?
wavs/03118.wav|May I help you? Who are you?
wavs/04294.wav|This disappointed me; and I owned it. His voice cracked and went flat WITH emotion.
wavs/04525.wav|The more you say anything, the less I shall believe it.
wavs/05688.wav|So there!
wavs/01550.wav|I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me. I mean what else is it about?
wavs/00472.wav|What is your occupational status?
wavs/03415.wav|But Tom had not promised immediate results, and no one gave up hope.
wavs/05667.wav|But he did not always ask me to collect it directly.
wavs/02119.wav|Heating device. Yeah so what?
wavs/03544.wav|Serious reasons?
wavs/03257.wav|What kind of stuff?
wavs/04320.wav|The talk veered then, but still focused on the war.
wavs/01050.wav|People change.
wavs/01010.wav|When have you first had symptoms?
wavs/00372.wav|Don't you know it yet? Oh no
wavs/03526.wav|Doctor Middleton has one of the grandest HEADS in England.
wavs/00846.wav|Yeah I'm sorry too. But I gotta tell you
wavs/00612.wav|Don't worry.
wavs/01512.wav|Yes? Oh my God.
wavs/04866.wav|Will, who is your mother's father's mother's father?
wavs/03217.wav|Was the diagnosis confirmed as
wavs/06620.wav|It's your bedtime. They were so extremely curious.
wavs/01035.wav|If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
wavs/01422.wav|Which occupation has been recommended to you?
wavs/04597.wav|But suppose we go down and take a look.
wavs/02476.wav|Yeah. No.
wavs/05294.wav|I enter, and lie couched upon the floor.
wavs/05511.wav|The Seventh and Last Petition.
wavs/01882.wav|Just because I'm in charge, I'm not a different person. Then come, hang out. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
wavs/05246.wav|We're both old American stock. Oh, I have had a letter from Moscow.
wavs/06289.wav|He will not say so, he dare not, he cannot.
wavs/03005.wav|How is your visual impairment currently corrected left eye
wavs/06052.wav|I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.
wavs/02528.wav|Everything was figured out. Now it's like. We don't know where we're going.
wavs/03362.wav|That is not where your problem lies. Enter Cordelia and Kent.
wavs/01723.wav|Hell is filled with people like you.
wavs/01350.wav|Could I have We're all out. Anybody else?
wavs/00054.wav|Did you have, or do you plan to have any further tests?
wavs/04382.wav|The Lord is with us!
wavs/05675.wav|Instead, it would be the PRODUCT of the course directors, Ian and Randy.
wavs/03876.wav|They can be seen devouring cherries among the wheat.
wavs/00300.wav|I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
wavs/04785.wav|But his professional experience is good for him. "You forget," I said, "that she has left England without telling me where to find her." Ay, you were a buxom lass then.
wavs/06402.wav|I started.
wavs/03728.wav|All constraint with the master had disappeared long ago. I'm so glad it's over!
wavs/04057.wav|And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.
wavs/03004.wav|You'll find someone. The right woman is waiting for you. It's easy for you to say. You found one already.
wavs/04277.wav|What means this new fantasy?
wavs/05585.wav|Regent Street!
wavs/05482.wav|One of my neighbors was ROBBED last night. Just about the square, for air?
wavs/01237.wav|Really? Yeah. If we put our heads together, between the two of us
wavs/03241.wav|I mean, what if all we've got are beans? Get him! Get him! Get him!
wavs/04362.wav|They ought. At times she read and wrote a good deal.
wavs/06272.wav|This is no kinsman and no cousin neither.
wavs/03906.wav|You putting up at the Brunswick? O pardon me my Lord of Guise.
wavs/06223.wav|They informed me that Miss Rachel flatly refused to have her wardrobe examined.
wavs/05432.wav|She turned away her head with a little shudder.
wavs/05313.wav|The heavy hinges began to move; it was obviously some kind of password.
wavs/05974.wav|How does the law of nature prescribe filial love?
wavs/00677.wav|Who who wants fair?
wavs/05971.wav|Henri was ALREADY up and at the window.
wavs/02545.wav|You're getting it all wrong. But at least I'm doing it.
wavs/06237.wav|For you know that there is to be a public funeral?
wavs/06010.wav|The flash passed, the night closed in again; and where was he? He possesses as deadly a weapon: and that weapon will kill at a distance.
wavs/06282.wav|Don't be frightened, you are as safe as a church.
wavs/04497.wav|Oh, I guess Reggie loves you well enough.
wavs/06327.wav|The contest was renewed by her father with the singing of the birds.
wavs/01029.wav|The very cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes. It's like returning to the scene of the crime.
wavs/04410.wav|No, sir; I wash my hands of the whole matter.
wavs/06452.wav|There must be a Hereafter because we cannot think of any end to life.
wavs/00399.wav|and couldn't decide who got to bring a date? Well, aren't we Mr. The Glass ls Half Empty?
wavs/05794.wav|How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
wavs/04986.wav|Are you sure the waves won't wash it away?
wavs/04538.wav|The minister did not KNOW what good he had done.
wavs/00601.wav|Do you know what it's like to grow up
wavs/05861.wav|Warn me!
wavs/05464.wav|He was alone, and, being in no hurry, he began examining the furniture.
wavs/04952.wav|The man was reading aloud from a book, while she sewed.
wavs/01593.wav|Let's talk reality for a second. Okay. When are you coming home? What? Guys, I'm not.
wavs/03037.wav|And I'm thinking
wavs/05473.wav|A serious difference of opinion, as you see!
wavs/06593.wav|What SORT of a job?
wavs/01395.wav|Well, I mean, I had a great time with you.
wavs/01500.wav|But hey
wavs/03158.wav|Well I'm not completely satisfied. Well, the label promises nutty goodness.
wavs/01339.wav|So how does it feel knowing you're about to die? But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.
wavs/06466.wav|Whose name?
wavs/03096.wav|Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking
wavs/00387.wav|Is your vision normal, either with or without glasses or contact lenses?
wavs/01335.wav|My friend was taking down our Christmas lights
wavs/06832.wav|Levin was silent. Where were the other six?
wavs/01275.wav|I have to listen to both. They don't let each other finish. Which one?
wavs/06029.wav|Gosh, no!
wavs/00363.wav|Please state the number of your dependants
wavs/06251.wav|The road to the south was the way to the station.
wavs/06445.wav|There were other alarms, all of them WITHOUT foundation.
wavs/03236.wav|Please provide more details regarding the further treatment or tests
wavs/01917.wav|That wouldn't be fair to me, to Alan, or to you. Well who wants fair?
wavs/03633.wav|Men who had come, men who were coming, met there on equal footing.
wavs/02300.wav|Get off!
wavs/03882.wav|Of course, Reggie received numerous hints as to the unpopularity of this jarring personality.
wavs/02612.wav|This is so unfair.
wavs/05329.wav|In the one in which he was about to engage, what was his situation?
wavs/04478.wav|Fill in your name, old man. Nothing and everything.
wavs/00574.wav|Good night you guys.
wavs/06259.wav|They behaved like children, and I was like an angel.
wavs/02502.wav|No it's good. It is good.
wavs/04118.wav|Why did I ask you to marry me?
wavs/00606.wav|than going back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
wavs/05397.wav|On the Sunday which followed his accession, his speech was quoted in many pulpits.
wavs/00584.wav|Why not? What I meant was You don't mind if I eat, do you?
wavs/02281.wav|For some short term work.
wavs/01755.wav|Yes! Like the man in the shoe! What shoe?
wavs/04650.wav|He drive four horses? You are all porter; and you know no more than they do.
wavs/01336.wav|Based on this play!
wavs/05938.wav|No trace of her was ever discovered. Away from this Palace of sin!
wavs/06137.wav|First, he wore glasses. And he BOWED to you like this?
wavs/03528.wav|The march was resumed early the next morning, without waiting for the stragglers.
wavs/02729.wav|There weren't clothes in it!
wavs/05657.wav|These are the summer days, and these our walks.
wavs/00651.wav|Movie star!
wavs/02648.wav|So would you guys. Would you like to sometime
wavs/04347.wav|He put his arm tenderly round her as they leaned over the parapet.
wavs/04203.wav|Alban gave her his hand. That's all we know about that. Hiram muttered.
wavs/02386.wav|so the sibling would feel like less of a failure. Yeah. No, that's not what I was saying.
wavs/00634.wav|Hello! Who are we spying on?
wavs/02254.wav|That could be it. Oh, God. You know this is still pretty hot.
wavs/02006.wav|You don't drink. That's right I don't.
wavs/03176.wav|So I have a flaw! Big deal!
wavs/01262.wav|Sometimes just things don't work out. This has nothing to do with him needing a note to get out of gym?
wavs/02927.wav|Only if you order stuff.
wavs/04735.wav|I am not responsible for her, and I refuse to be made responsible!
wavs/04445.wav|A more real sense of desolation came upon her.
wavs/03651.wav|Then he laughed, SHOWING his even, white teeth.
wavs/01385.wav|Yeah right!
wavs/02436.wav|It doesn't matter. I'll get them tomorrow. Or not! Whenever.
wavs/04081.wav|Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love when any body else is by?
wavs/00088.wav|It's okay, it's okay. I'm here, I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.
wavs/04800.wav|This, O brave physician! Violet was too trying.
wavs/03715.wav|Like Chris.
wavs/05649.wav|Yes, I sinned, sinned greatly. The senator and his friend started along the highway.
wavs/00667.wav|Which races do you participate in?
wavs/00436.wav|I don't feel the thing. Honey you should always feel the thing.
wavs/02694.wav|How long do you do these activities?
wavs/04757.wav|And so adieu, sweet Jude!
wavs/01398.wav|What was the specific diagnosis?
wavs/03974.wav|Transparent Helena!
wavs/06426.wav|Oh, will the footsteps never be done? Bless my rice pudding!
wavs/00530.wav|I'm sorry. I came to give you this
wavs/01826.wav|But her friend sounds like a Pathetic mess. I know, but.
wavs/04324.wav|Is this a professional consultation?
wavs/01963.wav|The clothes are clean. That's the important part.
wavs/02401.wav|If you go to a hotel, you'll be doing stuff.
wavs/01458.wav|What? What?
wavs/01714.wav|Let me get it for you.
wavs/04813.wav|You saw?
wavs/05510.wav|But what insolence! Her strength was gone. Come, we will venture at once!
wavs/06018.wav|This people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
wavs/03553.wav|My influence ought to yield to yours. It's not dead, then?
wavs/04908.wav|Do you remember, at mother's, my maid Natasha?
wavs/01902.wav|What? What did you get me there? I got you
wavs/00765.wav|That's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here?
wavs/06369.wav|The accusation from which I had fled followed me.
wavs/02375.wav|He wasn't like
wavs/06197.wav|French, then.
wavs/00072.wav|What's different?
wavs/03341.wav|I would the fool were married to her grave.
wavs/03652.wav|I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert. You can't hide the black part.
wavs/02957.wav|Wait wait we talking about the coyotes here? Can you believe it?
wavs/01343.wav|Well, it's like that. With feelings.
wavs/01639.wav|What? There was no answer. I turned it off.
wavs/01818.wav|You serious? Oh yeah.
wavs/01092.wav|I couldn't handle the pressure. I snapped!
wavs/02523.wav|I put mine. Yep, that's me. I am that stupid.
wavs/00600.wav|What is it?
wavs/02273.wav|Do you take part in competitions?
wavs/02335.wav|Libraries, airplanes, movie theaters. Yeah.
wavs/02928.wav|Passes it up to Leetch.
wavs/04169.wav|So, then, I'll go fetch the letter on the instant.
wavs/01257.wav|Yeah like that's a word.
wavs/04703.wav|The Indian took no notice of the white men, and walked to the bed.
wavs/02218.wav|Folks are really that bad?
wavs/02574.wav|Which knee is involved?
wavs/02703.wav|If I were omnipotent for a day, I'd make myself omnipotent forever.
wavs/00419.wav|So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh? I think this is probably why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.
wavs/06642.wav|Shady doings, mate. The crowd around me shuddered, and pressed together.
wavs/01517.wav|Definitely not his mother. Oh, no! Wait, she's walking across the floor. She's walking, she's walking.
wavs/03307.wav|I mean I'm sorry too. But I'm a little relieved.
wavs/00396.wav|Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out. Well then can we meet him?
wavs/01993.wav|Are we greeting each other this way now? I like it. Nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
wavs/02474.wav|To see what she looks like. I'm sure her picture's up at the post office.
wavs/00999.wav|He's waking up. Hey, fella. How you doing?
wavs/05977.wav|No, I must have the money at once.
wavs/02144.wav|Do you still have symptoms or complications?
wavs/06740.wav|Very uneasy.
wavs/03111.wav|Yes. Yes it does.
wavs/05378.wav|Rely on your own opinion. Here is peace.
wavs/04194.wav|I do not wish to remove; I am well enough here.
wavs/04125.wav|Let us to work. Will you take my advice?
wavs/02276.wav|Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer
wavs/01424.wav|Alright don't tell me
wavs/05848.wav|I shall be no support to MRS. Weston.
wavs/00881.wav|Thanks Dad
wavs/05042.wav|I owe it to her to remember that.
wavs/03306.wav|Please enter the disorder
wavs/04417.wav|Have you come to talk about your election?
wavs/05054.wav|Owe!
wavs/05589.wav|Close by stood a boy who dashed his stick into a wet ditch.
wavs/04088.wav|Almost as long as Franklin. I watch her gestures, I know her secrets.
wavs/01754.wav|Okay, fine. Make jokes, I don't care. This is a big break for me!
wavs/06136.wav|Traces of volcanic eruptions were to be seen in various directions.
wavs/06163.wav|Will you consent to keep up appearances? Unfortunately, the Lady Beatrice is a fury.
wavs/05395.wav|Experience alone determines this little difference. Seventy pounds and odd.
wavs/00490.wav|What other symptoms have you had?
wavs/05445.wav|I didn't know where you were: I wasn't out of this house last night.
wavs/06438.wav|Keep your seat! We're at home here. He remembered her speaking of him.
wavs/00795.wav|and instead of putting her information
wavs/02264.wav|You told me something that was really difficult for you.
wavs/00453.wav|Where are you employed?
wavs/01715.wav|Okay please be good
wavs/00743.wav|Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes.
wavs/05292.wav|Sara Lee stood beside Mr. Travers, for companionship only. We had rehearsed it perfectly.
wavs/06539.wav|We may escape one but we cannot escape the other.
wavs/04550.wav|But her head she held up; she did not lay it down again.
wavs/00094.wav|For all we know he's horribly
wavs/04357.wav|As yet, we are gazing upon the undulating flow of the astral light.
wavs/00994.wav|Do you still have restrictions of movement or pain due to the shoulder?
wavs/04562.wav|Astounding, overwhelming.
wavs/05137.wav|It's all the same in a thousand years. Let it spread!
wavs/02393.wav|that it freaked you out? No, I hate him! No, we hate him!
wavs/01197.wav|They are doctors. Cute doctors. Doctors who are cute. All right, what have we learned so far?
wavs/05034.wav|I never was more delighted, father, in my life!
wavs/04726.wav|I will then address me to my appointment. "TAKE care," said he, "you'll cut yourself, I've a knife open."
wavs/00175.wav|I'm happy for you? Well, don't be!
wavs/00981.wav|I tell you, years from now, school children will study it
wavs/02627.wav|Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer
wavs/04675.wav|Would it have been a lie if I had said it was quite six?
wavs/01969.wav|Tell her what?
wavs/04354.wav|Annie led the way and the YOUNG man followed.
wavs/01964.wav|I haven't done that in a while. ls it a date if she doesn't know?
wavs/06588.wav|He went on talking to her as seriously as ever.
wavs/02668.wav|Dad!
wavs/00102.wav|But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see.
wavs/00573.wav|Go away! Stop looking in here!
wavs/01155.wav|I don't know. It looked better there. And it's an extra seat around the table.
wavs/05162.wav|I must speak of it.
wavs/05317.wav|Has the servant not given you my card?
wavs/02623.wav|He is? Why?
wavs/04614.wav|I had better tell you the way I know I love Miss Wood.
wavs/01921.wav|and complaining about them to you'. Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people'
wavs/01048.wav|Go go
wavs/06175.wav|She will be angry with me that I have dared to touch it.
wavs/01221.wav|I couldn't. Good for you.
wavs/06079.wav|I say that is the conduct of a WEAK man.
wavs/02930.wav|You are so stupid.
wavs/06004.wav|But if this is true, what is the application?
wavs/01120.wav|I mean I'm going to. So. Yeah I'd really Like that.
wavs/01861.wav|They're close.
wavs/03376.wav|What may your commands be, if you please?
wavs/03695.wav|But there was no time for brooding. Swords and pistols in your belts.
wavs/06427.wav|And when he had broken it, he began to eat.
wavs/00028.wav|would you like to go out with me? Thank you. Good night. There he is!
wavs/01601.wav|What were the other examination results?
wavs/00096.wav|How often did you suffer from your complaints in the last five years?
wavs/06333.wav|We really do not want you. WELL, she was worth it.
wavs/04814.wav|You see I'm settled at Lock Willow permanently. I know, JOE, I know.
wavs/02242.wav|Please describe what the complications are
wavs/01074.wav|Wait wait
wavs/06670.wav|This succeeded.
wavs/05652.wav|But to the high seas launch, my thought, his memory.
wavs/00258.wav|Oh. If you want, I'll just break it off with her.
wavs/01186.wav|Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting.
wavs/01496.wav|You really think so? Yeah, I really do.
wavs/00510.wav|Good morning. Good morning. Hello, Paul. Hi. Paul, is it?
wavs/03687.wav|I thought you took it quite easily, father.
wavs/03898.wav|He had left Grenada as late as the twelfth of May.
wavs/02058.wav|What juggling thing?
wavs/03012.wav|How was the first day?
wavs/04923.wav|She tossed her head, and turned her back on him in high indignation.
wavs/06166.wav|Some of the events pointed apparently toward coming repairs or alterations in the cottage.
wavs/03834.wav|Oh sister!
wavs/03816.wav|I understand what has brought you here. Here are dice.
wavs/03542.wav|Will you be so good, sir, to finish making out this estimate for me? But his enemies said: This Genoese is a wizard.
wavs/04102.wav|And you are not afraid of her telling?
wavs/04148.wav|He turned away without speaking further; and his mother's eyes followed him wistfully to the door.
wavs/01366.wav|Now he's happy. I mean, it's nice. He has a hobby.
wavs/04683.wav|As there were no screens, the windows had not been raised.
wavs/05435.wav|An outcry was made about tyranny. Moody looked at Isabel. Sustained "voluntary" interest is far more fatiguing than involuntary interest, and where fatigue is already present it becomes difficult and perhaps impossible.
wavs/01584.wav|He said, We should do it again.  That's good, right?
wavs/02589.wav|Well you were pretty damn good. Interesting. In my dreams, I'm surprisingly inadequate.
wavs/05269.wav|The landlady takes paper and pencil and writes.
wavs/05474.wav|Her own attitude was purely one of joyous expectancy.
wavs/02892.wav|During the last five years have you had a sexually transmitted disease or are you awaiting the result of such a test?
wavs/02494.wav|That was fun.
wavs/03226.wav|The usher gave me this.
wavs/03102.wav|Oh God.
wavs/05012.wav|A compliment is something like a kiss through a veil.
wavs/01218.wav|That's insurance fraud.
wavs/06781.wav|We shall not let you go away; if necessary, we shall keep you by force.
wavs/01922.wav|So which one of the two guys will you listen to? I have to listen to both. They don't let each other finish.
wavs/05152.wav|There was no doubt that he was shaking.
wavs/04405.wav|It is in our mind to put you back to CARRYING a load.
wavs/03952.wav|I asked him for Penelope. But with all these advantages LUTHER was miserable.
wavs/06337.wav|Catherine looked at her and relented. Clara Belle answered, looking at the clock.
wavs/05561.wav|"All the past is forgotten," said the King, "except the service which you did me in the debate on the Exclusion Bill."
wavs/02038.wav|No. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
wavs/03520.wav|At times he saw shadows flit across them, and his heart began to beat.
wavs/03078.wav|That's where you're wrong! Why would I marry her
wavs/02563.wav|Come on. Thank you.
wavs/04639.wav|Oh, I'm not jealous! How you did manage matters!
wavs/00297.wav|Oh my God! Okay I'll be there.
wavs/05600.wav|Shame upon me! The elder stopped, and looked at her mother.
wavs/00228.wav|I feel great. I feel great.
wavs/05308.wav|In my judgment, Socrates, the question has now become ridiculous.
wavs/02644.wav|He's back. The peeper's back. Get down! Get down?
wavs/04419.wav|She was thus surrounded by dangerous relations and intimate enemies.
wavs/05786.wav|Immediately he tore his garments, and rolled upon the pavement uttering piercing cries.
wavs/03709.wav|I do not know WHAT your father was!
wavs/05574.wav|How can I do it? For you, good little friend!
wavs/00381.wav|Look at them. Look at how happy they are. Oh, my God, I'm late! Oh, no!
wavs/03126.wav|How long did the complaints last?
wavs/02518.wav|Listen, maybe we could get together later? That sounds good. I'll call you. Or you call me, whatever.
wavs/02780.wav|Do you usually dive
wavs/03839.wav|Only promise me that you will smile. Certainly he is.
wavs/06389.wav|Tell me your mind; I am a messenger.
wavs/02230.wav|No, I was just saying we're not sitting together. But now that you mention it, there was ice that night.
wavs/06554.wav|In the dark, I have brought you thus far.
wavs/06286.wav|Change YOUR mind, before it is too late!
wavs/02929.wav|I just have to know okay? Is it my hair?
wavs/01626.wav|One might wonder. But I would be fine with that.
wavs/04337.wav|The parlor has been transformed into a library.
wavs/01382.wav|Always yelling. Nothing made him happy.
wavs/03270.wav|Have you ever drank more than this in the past?
wavs/04763.wav|Less than that, by our reckoning. You are welcome, gentlemen.
wavs/03778.wav|Dorothea wondered; but the smile was irresistible, and shone back from her face too.
wavs/00682.wav|That's gonna be you and me.
wavs/02750.wav|What type of motocross do you do?
wavs/01178.wav|Hello sweetheart.
wavs/04617.wav|The next morning. And there's no such house.
wavs/03989.wav|Ten thousand DOLLARS a year!
wavs/04771.wav|I never dared to go near the place afterward; no, nor your father either!
wavs/03694.wav|I'll wait here with the greatest pleasure till you come back. Were you there?
wavs/00968.wav|You listen to me! You listen to me!
wavs/02531.wav|She's on the other line. She's gonna call me back.
wavs/03683.wav|It blots out all that life of mine!
wavs/04557.wav|Moreover, no one guards a secret like a child.
wavs/04407.wav|Ascending Currents.
wavs/00673.wav|And not in a good way. How can people do that?
wavs/03782.wav|Take me to those twins. Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
wavs/02822.wav|they don't. They don't?
wavs/00146.wav|So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again
wavs/03276.wav|Well it looks good there too. Let's leave it there for a while.
wavs/00811.wav|What? Uh I also have something else for you.
wavs/00996.wav|We should always break up together.
wavs/01027.wav|I shouldn't have come.
wavs/04863.wav|Bonaparte understood.
wavs/05651.wav|The wise way, with a man like my master, is the peaceable way.
wavs/01946.wav|Oh oh
wavs/01430.wav|In which area do you work?
wavs/04454.wav|Nothing is now to be had gratis. Can I jest as well as not?
wavs/03018.wav|How many flying hours do you have?
wavs/05777.wav|What do you want to do, get our fire insurance cancelled?
wavs/00757.wav|She shops where I'm afraid of the salespeople.
wavs/06682.wav|I do not yawn and talk whilst he is singing.
wavs/05623.wav|I should be still more unhappy than I am.
wavs/01819.wav|Well okay
wavs/01139.wav|He is people! He has a name, okay?
wavs/05706.wav|The air grew more SULTRY. There is no conformity in doctrine, faith, and life.
wavs/05773.wav|I believe that she could not have been lying.
wavs/02855.wav|Which safety regulations are available?
wavs/01552.wav|It's been a long day. Oh, sure.
wavs/03389.wav|All his desires were gone forever; he wished to go nowhere, and to do nothing.
wavs/02581.wav|Let go! Come on it's my cart.
wavs/01213.wav|What are you doing?
wavs/04988.wav|How goes it, little friend? Let's KEEP them on together.
wavs/05970.wav|He had a pleasant home, and his prospects for the future were bright.
wavs/00912.wav|Fill this out and bring it back.
wavs/05343.wav|And the same is the case with everything else?
wavs/06768.wav|No woman could captivate me.
wavs/05039.wav|Willoughby had been a handsome, fair boy. We met no great forest beasts.
wavs/00076.wav|Sure. No problem.
wavs/05182.wav|Nay, we must longer kneel; I am a suitor.
wavs/03303.wav|I mean, what is that? Please!
wavs/02204.wav|Shut up! Tell me what?
wavs/05045.wav|The woman was looking at him with incredulous, pitiful eyes like a dog's.
wavs/06109.wav|I smoothed out the crumpled paper and read.
wavs/00443.wav|Wow, are you in trouble! Big time!
wavs/00702.wav|You guys okay?
wavs/00567.wav|Why do you have to break up with her?
wavs/04336.wav|What flowers are you having? How could I disappoint her?
wavs/00038.wav|My secretary's gonna be out. I could be a secretary.
wavs/04097.wav|Eugenie trembled in every limb. A very poor etymology.
wavs/05851.wav|The proud eyes were radiant.
wavs/00669.wav|Since when do you suffer from respiratory complaints?
wavs/00202.wav|Have the stones been removed?
wavs/03262.wav|How long do your symptoms or complaints last on average?
wavs/01469.wav|If it'll make you feel any better
wavs/06336.wav|Absorbed in herself, Anne failed to hear him.
wavs/02532.wav|God he's good.
wavs/06621.wav|Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
wavs/03472.wav|Maybe it was a place where some one camped out during the summer.
wavs/03691.wav|She's a nice, attentive girl. It was not one of her lucky days.
wavs/01291.wav|Excellent! Everyone was so, so nice! Me.
wavs/00478.wav|I'm okay.
wavs/00035.wav|Give her a break. It's hard being on your own. Thank you.
wavs/04151.wav|The Alps?
wavs/06149.wav|Wherefore, sweetheart?
wavs/03235.wav|and take a couple of punches. This feels great!
wavs/02860.wav|or we lived in biblical times
wavs/05556.wav|But they are very cheap, and they mean so much, Jean.
wavs/00477.wav|honing for the last two hours?
wavs/01046.wav|Wait wait!
wavs/06615.wav|A man is known by the company he keeps.
wavs/05784.wav|How I catch myself out! My loss would be irreparable.
wavs/05642.wav|I would know nothing about bringing up girls. One thing only was simple.
wavs/01114.wav|For how long will you be unable to work?
wavs/04553.wav|Typical miracle?
wavs/01192.wav|I always figured, when the right one comes along
wavs/04486.wav|He looks as if he could poison everybody.
wavs/03769.wav|She is expecting him to come back daily.
wavs/02908.wav|Too many jokes.
wavs/06708.wav|And can I go into it without disturbing anybody?
wavs/01948.wav|When did you last receive treatment?
wavs/00722.wav|She says, as time goes on, he's gonna start getting violent. So what does this mean?
wavs/00770.wav|I gotta go. Miss you too. Excuse me?
wavs/04906.wav|So rushes old France: old France is rushing down.
wavs/05739.wav|Thus none could depart, and none could enter.
wavs/02720.wav|The laundry song we sing.
wavs/00922.wav|I just want But you can't.
wavs/00158.wav|I always forget that part.
wavs/05211.wav|Nothing but peace and gentle visitation. The monks became industrious.
wavs/05396.wav|Venters let him run a few rods, then with iron arm checked him.
wavs/02707.wav|Please state the degree of relationship of person with such a disease
wavs/06629.wav|But do not therefore hate me! After what I have promised you? "How poor a place compared with this," they thought to themselves, "is our world!"
wavs/03840.wav|Fair one turn you down? Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs.
wavs/04783.wav|What was I to do on my side?
wavs/04010.wav|Are not these the THEMES of which Homer sings?
wavs/06355.wav|Gave me the knife? I cannot blame his conscience.
wavs/03342.wav|In a few minutes she was asleep. A friar?
wavs/02080.wav|How much time at work do you spend on your activities?
wavs/00545.wav|It's my baby too.
wavs/00566.wav|Was the disorder diagnosed as malignant?
wavs/04787.wav|Quite comfortable, sir. Thomson threw down his revolver.
wavs/04308.wav|It is to be hoped it was a very young person who needed to ask who "composed" that expression!
wavs/06448.wav|Really, I would like to have you do so.
wavs/02781.wav|Who is being loud?
wavs/03409.wav|Let's LOOK at your horse.
wavs/03196.wav|Do you suffer from one of the listed symptoms?
wavs/04047.wav|Jokes were all very well, but this was carrying the thing too far.
wavs/02450.wav|I'm sorry. Is that your basket? What?
wavs/04237.wav|I've looked at things from the wrong side.
wavs/04729.wav|And his soul REMEMBERED Rome.
wavs/02363.wav|And I can't break up with you. Yes, you can.
wavs/01870.wav|Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
wavs/04686.wav|I think of her, morning, noon, and night.
wavs/02839.wav|What are you doing? All right, great. Great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
wavs/01479.wav|No I'm not.
wavs/00493.wav|When did the immunotherapy end?
wavs/06756.wav|They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.
wavs/04638.wav|My disappointment was keen. But the very reverse is true.
wavs/03756.wav|Where's some brandy? Why so sadly Greet you our victory?
wavs/05068.wav|He began to eat; he continued to eat; in fact, he did well.
wavs/04904.wav|Cannot the landlord assist you?
wavs/03719.wav|I am afraid, I said, that the argument about friendship is false: arguments, like men, are often pretenders.
wavs/02905.wav|It was great seeing you again. Remember they're just food
wavs/01558.wav|It was the first frost. Sit. Just sit down. Sit.
wavs/02463.wav|I don't care! Yeah, all right.
wavs/06789.wav|"Four o'clock," he said, as he pulled on his mittens, "and we've already passed three hundred." So I went with him. Then at night we spin.
wavs/04589.wav|Simple questions are thankfully received, and get better answers than long, or tricky ones.
wavs/06312.wav|At the first step forward that I took, something stopped me.
wavs/00776.wav|Everyone thinks they know me.
wavs/03831.wav|You think I am shamelessly heartless in telling you this.
wavs/03939.wav|A difficult girl to deal with; she has found out her own value to me already.
wavs/00587.wav|Seriously what's the part? Oh my God!
wavs/04591.wav|But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once.
wavs/00748.wav|Or he just complains a lot?
wavs/02016.wav|Word of advice: Bring back the comedian.
wavs/04156.wav|It must have been startling enough to them.
wavs/01118.wav|I have to give you something.
wavs/06239.wav|Do they need what little I can give? All the keepers know him.
wavs/02566.wav|Wait does he eat chalk? Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date.
wavs/06276.wav|And the disciples hearing fell upon their face, and were very much afraid.
wavs/02095.wav|and men with emotional problems can hear? Come here. Give me your feet.
wavs/03498.wav|Fatigued by a rapid journey, Paul slept TILL evening.
wavs/00496.wav|Excuse me.
wavs/02372.wav|Please state the name of current employer
wavs/04516.wav|Has the body been examined by a medical man?
wavs/01742.wav|Did you ever have an accident when you performed your duties?
wavs/03384.wav|Tommy's swagger?
wavs/01686.wav|What? We're just friends. Fine. Fine.
wavs/05279.wav|And among legislators, there are some who do their work better and some worse?
wavs/05390.wav|Then the whole population flocked to church to listen to an early mass.
wavs/03874.wav|Just then the party from the stables returned.
wavs/01344.wav|Do you participate in National, European or World championships?
wavs/03501.wav|It is always easy to get rid of a man who loves women.
wavs/03720.wav|I never lived on a cash BASIS before. She sighed.
wavs/00747.wav|and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn.
wavs/01391.wav|Do that for two hours, you might be where I am about now. That puts that whole pillow thing in perspective.
wavs/03070.wav|You can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle
wavs/06783.wav|She was a LITTLE child then. He began to yawn.
wavs/05504.wav|There was a chair, a shelf for books, and a narrow folding bed.
wavs/01316.wav|Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep,
wavs/06720.wav|Antiochus quarrels with Simon, and sends troops to annoy him.
wavs/05663.wav|By how they treat the people around them.
wavs/06830.wav|Give me that deed of sale. Brought low.
wavs/06320.wav|Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.
wavs/06318.wav|He hath commanded me to go to bed, And bade me to dismiss you.
wavs/03071.wav|Don't do that. But I'm asking you.
wavs/06125.wav|And a nice place, too, though a TRIFLE damp.
wavs/03736.wav|I promise you that he shall sit up all night and examine them.
wavs/00108.wav|Then I've already seen this one.
wavs/05095.wav|Can this be Mr. Darcy? All former charges have been child's play to this.
wavs/06544.wav|Then they began to exchange their theories about the cipher.
wavs/06793.wav|But Ethel could not smile.
wavs/02248.wav|No. Nothing like that.
wavs/00127.wav|No. Because you need that. No, it's okay, thanks. Please let me do something.
wavs/04235.wav|Now, that Jennings girl looks like a little picture.
wavs/06164.wav|Why, you seem quite staggered!
wavs/02068.wav|Excuse me. Come on, she's a person. You can do it.
wavs/03429.wav|I could not credit his hint of it yesterday.
wavs/03551.wav|I've tried to tell you half a dozen times before. "It's a long trail to follow," he said, slowly, "trying to get back dues from the government."
wavs/05796.wav|But how about the RESPONSIBILITY and the insurance?
wavs/04201.wav|Where did you pick up the creature? This language also can be learned.
wavs/03302.wav|I can't sleep in a public place.
wavs/06586.wav|Not a fact has been omitted, not a detail exaggerated.
wavs/05725.wav|But the emotion was deep. I can still enjoy myself.
wavs/05635.wav|But I'll give you all the help I can.
wavs/02121.wav|Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back.
wavs/05434.wav|Think of objects in foreground, middle ground, background; of details of color and form.
wavs/04561.wav|Let us argue that some one gave him the poison.
wavs/03953.wav|Attention.
wavs/00365.wav|There's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
wavs/06346.wav|The chair rolled swiftly forward and in another minute had disappeared.
wavs/00475.wav|What examinations have been or will be done, and what were the results?
wavs/03899.wav|Yea; is it so? Then she took a full LOOK at him, and sat up.
wavs/02260.wav|They say it's the same as the distance from
wavs/01518.wav|Do you know what you're doing for New Year's? Hey, what? What is wrong with New Year's?
wavs/06538.wav|Then I must go to court and see the Queen.
wavs/05841.wav|The shepherd was formally introduced and many compliments and kind inquiries were exchanged.
wavs/05442.wav|How so. But what does it all avail to me?
wavs/06635.wav|This morose journeyman had no liking for me.
wavs/01288.wav|no I'm sorry
wavs/00841.wav|This is just for tonight. Tomorrow you gotta change. Change?
wavs/02201.wav|What? Can I use your phone?
wavs/01228.wav|What's going on? Was your basket on top?
wavs/05531.wav|I to mine own apartment will go. Am I reserved, Marianne?
wavs/04415.wav|I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you.
wavs/05744.wav|Then the very next year, they were the pits.
wavs/04034.wav|If the conditions were simply sporadic and local, the case might be different.
wavs/06368.wav|Shall not the majority seven control the minority one?
wavs/01937.wav|Good to meet you. You too. What happened to the puppet guy?
wavs/05186.wav|I am quite content to address him as Captain Lingard.
wavs/02762.wav|Did you suffer or do you suffer from any of the following disorders?
wavs/01880.wav|And what did you bring?
wavs/02334.wav|I would have to say that is an L shaped bracket. Which goes where? I have no idea.
wavs/00483.wav|Not after what happened with Steve.
wavs/02690.wav|When was the surgery done left eye
wavs/05665.wav|Well, I DON'T say my prayers any more.
wavs/06373.wav|Would you like me to break the door in?
wavs/06192.wav|"Yea," said Ralph, "what is it then?" I am hurt. He has pretty hands, and rings prettier still.
wavs/01711.wav|I don't know, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
wavs/02384.wav|And special occasions.
wavs/06686.wav|Marius turned away his eyes.
wavs/03061.wav|I've got lots of pictures with both of us in them.
wavs/06800.wav|In faith I will. Then now we have to consider, What is money?
wavs/02631.wav|Oh! Oh God! What is this?!
wavs/03297.wav|Which side of your body is involved?
wavs/03467.wav|But she was awakened about midnight by a strange sensation in her throat.
wavs/01815.wav|What, not work out? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
wavs/02737.wav|but if you want, you can come by if you'd like.
wavs/04462.wav|They had committed some sin: it was for that reason they were lepers.
wavs/01236.wav|What symptoms or complications do you have?
wavs/03269.wav|And not just at the fun stuff, but, like, talking too.
wavs/06322.wav|His OPPOSITION, if it existed, was merely negative.
wavs/03119.wav|Have you never done this before? Well, not myself. But I know other people that have.
wavs/02188.wav|So as I'm going to get into a cab, she tackles me!
wavs/03732.wav|And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.
wavs/02937.wav|I'm just serving it. I'll have a cup of coffee.
wavs/00501.wav|No, no, no. Remember who you're dealing with here.
wavs/00625.wav|No, thanks. We're just here to observe. What does she mean?
wavs/04316.wav|After this failure, she deposed the Deity from omnipotence.
wavs/00656.wav|Great. Now he's waving back. We gotta do something about him.
wavs/05880.wav|This man cannot escape. The fellow was as drunk as he could be.
wavs/00317.wav|Which other authorisations do you have?
wavs/05575.wav|On deck I could see a crowd at the windlass heaving up anchor.
wavs/01941.wav|Roger wants to take her out. No! Remember why you dumped him?
wavs/04329.wav|What does he owe? He WANTED her money for colleges.
wavs/00676.wav|it was really nice. You would've liked it.
wavs/04234.wav|You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
wavs/02081.wav|Come on he's not that bad.
wavs/02198.wav|Are you an amateur only?
wavs/05774.wav|But keep secret what I have told you.
wavs/04778.wav|Now, take care before you open your mouth.
wavs/01383.wav|I understand. I'm really sorry.
wavs/01559.wav|Wow. I'm, I'm really sorry.
wavs/03167.wav|Relieved?
wavs/01419.wav|I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at
wavs/05391.wav|Then you should feel a desire to gain still more control.
wavs/00712.wav|When did you take the medications?
wavs/04152.wav|If not, why cease you till you are so?
wavs/03605.wav|Papa thought me a little stronger; he said my eyes were not so sunken.
wavs/01589.wav|Anyway, the valentine T om left in your locker was really from me!
wavs/04012.wav|And she's sure to have neighbours CALLING in and so on.
wavs/05159.wav|A lady in whom I was interested had died in a provincial town.
wavs/02084.wav|We are both so stupid.
wavs/01933.wav|These are white cotton panties. That would be a judgment call.
wavs/05612.wav|They sit about on benches, crossing their legs in a most shameless manner.
wavs/03327.wav|Honey honey
wavs/04080.wav|I love you because I love myself, you say. And they launched forth.
wavs/00232.wav|What caused your impaired hearing?
wavs/01698.wav|I wish I could, but I don't want to.
wavs/04207.wav|Lucien tore open the note, and learned that Mme.
wavs/01159.wav|We have to talk.
wavs/03878.wav|Sir Walter persisted in his purpose and went to Florence.
wavs/04444.wav|Corresponding to or resembling some other thing or object. I reflected a little.
wavs/04418.wav|The first hitch in the proceedings occurred at this point.
wavs/03455.wav|The Duchess came to see me as PALE as death; she really was very brave.
wavs/00551.wav|Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.
wavs/00342.wav|It's like if you woke up and found out
wavs/00837.wav|Who's gonna take the first shot? Come on!
wavs/00376.wav|And I would have to say
wavs/03049.wav|but you're the only person I know here.
wavs/01138.wav|How many have you had? I don't know. A million!
wavs/06658.wav|They were not to blame for this chance meeting now.
wavs/06161.wav|Why, there's a toe all the way down there!
wavs/01991.wav|Do you have a plan? I don't even have a pla.
wavs/04199.wav|And get on with your grog. Those are good tidings.
wavs/00654.wav|That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?
wavs/03050.wav|how inappropriate this is.
wavs/00246.wav|Do you have any planned surgery?
wavs/02010.wav|That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. No no no! I don't care I don't care! Game's over!
wavs/06041.wav|You have quarreled more deeply than I know of.
wavs/04367.wav|Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? Poor Queen Mary was ambitious.
wavs/03277.wav|I'll be able to go the distance. Now I'm looking at my dad thinking
wavs/03144.wav|I thought you knew.
wavs/03491.wav|I must not let him out of my sight.
wavs/03330.wav|You're right. I mean you're right!
wavs/06530.wav|He ate and drank much, and slept twelve round hours.
wavs/02681.wav|Okay! What's going on? They're just talking.
wavs/01126.wav|Oh God. How you doing? Hey, Dad.
wavs/01169.wav|Yeah. Yeah it is.
wavs/06651.wav|Isn't that a happy frame of mind to be in?
wavs/05603.wav|I know your thoughts; but are you not condemning me without a knowledge of the facts?
wavs/03743.wav|You hope?
wavs/00267.wav|That does not sound stupid to me. Uh oh. What?
wavs/04737.wav|If this was the way he took to drink, then I needn't worry.
wavs/01286.wav|You know what? I think we can leave it at that.
wavs/01752.wav|Man, can you believe he's only had sex with one woman? I think it's great. You know, it's sweet.
wavs/00926.wav|I can't believe it.
wavs/00223.wav|Are you gonna go over there? No. Yeah. No.
wavs/03198.wav|Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Who's gonna take the first shot hmm?
wavs/06203.wav|But where is the treasure?
wavs/00056.wav|I'm rubber, you're glue. Whatever you
wavs/06625.wav|She ran on as fast as she could.
wavs/05752.wav|That atmosphere, my good sir, is getting close; my Moral Being requires ventilation.
wavs/02602.wav|He's angry with me. I have no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.
wavs/06167.wav|It does not mean anything.
wavs/03161.wav|This is so great!
wavs/00336.wav|Do you participate in competitions or record attempts?
wavs/00714.wav|was I any good?
wavs/05471.wav|It's hot.
wavs/03186.wav|Nothing. This horrible woman just took my machine. Was your basket on top?
wavs/06100.wav|No one ever made me.
wavs/00452.wav|Just remember how much you all like me.
wavs/03492.wav|When did he leave home?
wavs/04076.wav|Skate together!
wavs/04059.wav|Then, my good friend, do they all speak?
wavs/04864.wav|I don't want to get into a mess with you.
wavs/06470.wav|It shows, too, how Dante composed his poem.
wavs/05697.wav|Presently I made out that they had seen others of these islands and shores.
wavs/02434.wav|This one?
wavs/04651.wav|No responsibility on my part.
wavs/02093.wav|He hasn't been around. Hello? What? Hey. Hi.
wavs/05902.wav|All his conduct and gestures were THOSE of a desperate man.
wavs/00325.wav|What type of bike do you ride?
wavs/00878.wav|Why are you here? When I got the right one, there was no answer.
wavs/01447.wav|and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. So how'd he take it?
wavs/00688.wav|What area of your body do you suffer symptoms?
wavs/06300.wav|The lady colored, paid the look back with interest, and slowly walked on.
wavs/03710.wav|It hath put as it were a veil between me and that awful night.
wavs/06053.wav|He advanced on the platform, not seeming to see me.
wavs/06715.wav|When Kitty reached home with her treasures she found her mother fast asleep.
wavs/03191.wav|I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
wavs/03996.wav|My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty.
wavs/05995.wav|Ain't I a DOCTOR? Yes, ignorance and cupidity!
wavs/01823.wav|Right but
wavs/02337.wav|You can. It's like pulling off a Band Aid.
wavs/05823.wav|The old man gave a look at the sky.
wavs/00865.wav|I got the extended version with choruses of
wavs/00225.wav|No, I know. That's part of the whole
wavs/00792.wav|Which side of the body was affected?
wavs/00971.wav|Well that's what we said about Joey. You'd think you would be more understanding.
wavs/03123.wav|Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
wavs/06491.wav|She went on with her questions, unabashed. Balthazar was right.
wavs/00519.wav|I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. What? Relax your hand!
wavs/02416.wav|I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't being clear. This was our cart. There weren't clothes in it!
wavs/04936.wav|They prove themselves sterling sportsmen and remarkable players. I madly cried, pointing at him.
wavs/03601.wav|Though not for Rome itself. Yet listen to me.
wavs/04154.wav|Marius awoke.
wavs/05488.wav|What was the first thing you ever wanted very much?
wavs/04876.wav|And opposites are the most unlike of things.
wavs/05223.wav|I have not seen a fish before that could laugh.
wavs/04015.wav|There was no sense in running for covers.
wavs/06802.wav|They're riding straight up the canon, in the middle distance.
wavs/01433.wav|Sure. So how long you been?
wavs/05190.wav|I could not hear the rhythm of the march.
wavs/04546.wav|We're coming!
wavs/05255.wav|Will anything happen? The young man considered briefly.
wavs/04067.wav|You can think of many very good exercises like this.
wavs/02638.wav|There you go. There you go. Hey, Janice, when I invited you, I didn't think it meant
wavs/04571.wav|A rash! If there was anything else, I'd tell you so; but there ain't.
wavs/03274.wav|or wear Rocky and Rocky, or you can mix and match. Moose and squirrel.
wavs/05648.wav|Now, what art is there which delivers us from poverty?
wavs/03108.wav|that means she didn't get her messages yet. You obviously saw my personal ad.
wavs/01043.wav|Sorry, my thing was in there with me. How's it going?
wavs/00174.wav|It doesn't matter. I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!
wavs/04926.wav|But Mr. Beverly did not counsel buying the stock.
wavs/01099.wav|tell them the story about your patient
wavs/05098.wav|This is particularly true with regard to criminal conditions.
wavs/05780.wav|But did you perceive her earnest? Whither could they fly?
wavs/00466.wav|Like your parents putting the dog to sleep
wavs/05102.wav|Pen has finished it. Somebody has been telling them lies.
wavs/01311.wav|Have you been or are you being treated by a physician?
wavs/04853.wav|Let us step in, and help to revenge their injury.
wavs/01153.wav|Okay, and we'll be here, hating you!
wavs/01693.wav|I can't do it. Listen, give me back my puck. No.
wavs/06362.wav|But, hark!
wavs/00111.wav|Nope.
wavs/00092.wav|What's going on? Oh my God. Don't do that.
wavs/01885.wav|Has a urinalysis been performed?
wavs/00508.wav|Let's just stick a pin in it.
wavs/00764.wav|Please state your earned income of the last three years
wavs/03095.wav|What treatment are you taking?
wavs/03580.wav|No, old chap. What distresses you, distresses me.
wavs/05682.wav|It will be longer. In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk.
wavs/00284.wav|Wow! You keep saying that.
wavs/02079.wav|Sure.
wavs/04432.wav|He thought he had heard a sound of barking.
wavs/03094.wav|What is the cause of your disorder?
wavs/01324.wav|Great it's gym class all over again. You can come up to the front and dance with me.
wavs/04342.wav|And the first horseman appeared on a white horse.
wavs/06104.wav|I must tell you all about Patty now.
wavs/00945.wav|Do you still have symptoms or any treatment including medication or therapy?
wavs/02139.wav|Which lung functions tests have been made? When and what was the result?
wavs/04408.wav|Where solemn rushes whisper, and funny ripples quiver.
wavs/02288.wav|It was horrible! He called me young lady.
wavs/04626.wav|Victory gave my hand a quick, excited little squeeze.
wavs/03325.wav|That's weird. I had a blast with him.
wavs/01658.wav|Yeah. I already asked Janice. What?
wavs/01974.wav|Are you being followed up or receiving any treatment now?
wavs/06012.wav|They are all for what they can get.
wavs/02617.wav|Out of my league!
wavs/03182.wav|Have you suffered any complications during surgery?
wavs/01869.wav|You just gotta do it. I know. But it's just so hard.
wavs/06292.wav|To Miss Lindsay, I presume. What a coincidence! They had drawn me on.
wavs/06663.wav|What are the advantages promised to counterbalance these disadvantages?
wavs/06015.wav|But soon other thoughts and feelings began to influence me.
wavs/05461.wav|"And now," said Tarzan, "we will sit down and eat." AFTER these words the twain set out to the goodly halls.
wavs/03863.wav|It was small, but delightfully furnished in the most modern fashion.
wavs/04267.wav|They have their times of plenty and times of famine.
wavs/05636.wav|I've been there often. Finally, there were two doors; perhaps they might be forced.
wavs/01513.wav|Not a good day for birds.
wavs/00772.wav|I have to give him up.
wavs/06551.wav|Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
wavs/05335.wav|Lincoln was not a believer in general negro SUFFRAGE. He's firing in the air!
wavs/01681.wav|So how's this all gonna work?
wavs/01837.wav|Do still suffer any complications and or or complaints?
wavs/03468.wav|It SHOWS how rich it is in discoveries.
wavs/00800.wav|Do you suffer from any allergic skin reaction?
wavs/05499.wav|This circumstance will explain the excessive nicety of his linen.
wavs/00182.wav|It felt like a big guy moment.
wavs/05240.wav|What, my pet! What are you telling Miss Bennet?
wavs/02117.wav|No. Yeah.
wavs/01411.wav|Since when have you been free of symptoms?
wavs/01668.wav|You never knew she was a lesbian?
wavs/04693.wav|Drink all, and left no friendly drop To help me after?
wavs/03656.wav|This about "the form of society" was merely wool pulled over my eyes.
wavs/00514.wav|and he can be really sweet. And in some ways, I think he is so right for me.
wavs/02842.wav|But you can't actually test this theory. Today's particle accelerators aren't powerful enough
wavs/05456.wav|And he who is in pain is evil?
wavs/01104.wav|Where have you been? Are you drunk? No.
wavs/03470.wav|The crocodile! They were pamphlets about the early Church. Why take our guns?
wavs/00927.wav|So you don't think I have
wavs/01859.wav|Yeah it's interesting. But you know what? Just for fun
wavs/00039.wav|You're not him you're you. When they wanted you in your father's business, did you cave?
wavs/01940.wav|And even if I was happy and skipping
wavs/01216.wav|These people never get cancer.
wavs/03966.wav|I agree with both of you, my sons.
wavs/03221.wav|Oh, I did? Yeah. It's hard for me to tell. My eye's closing up.
wavs/03983.wav|Ah, Montague!
wavs/03132.wav|How often have you or do you suffer from symptoms?
wavs/03044.wav|This whole courtroom's out of order! 
wavs/04811.wav|Must I abandon the enterprise? Her eyes and hands are raised toward heaven.
wavs/02141.wav|in that
wavs/02020.wav|I'm pregnant. Pregnant. She didn't leave in such a hurry after all.
wavs/01289.wav|Could that report be any Later? I don't sound Like that.
wavs/05179.wav|Why should I be afraid?
wavs/00986.wav|Will you just leave her the message? Okay. All right fine.
wavs/04781.wav|And will you receive him if he does come back?
wavs/04950.wav|Now the greenwood rose close at hand. If only they get it under!
wavs/03469.wav|I failed to scent danger when it threatened you.
wavs/00049.wav|Do you take part in any competitive events?
wavs/05093.wav|"Ah," said the architect, "nobody can do better than well." One question, first. Easy goes.
wavs/05999.wav|In his scheme, good women were to know only a fragment of men's lives.
wavs/01173.wav|Okay. Let's do laundry.
wavs/04468.wav|A coward! I wish you would take care now, Tom.
wavs/01862.wav|Isn't there? Yeah, yeah. I think there is.
wavs/01791.wav|When has the diagnosis been made?
wavs/06424.wav|More than three weeks, too? Saddle my horse.
wavs/01206.wav|Well yeah. Oh God!
wavs/04899.wav|But it was my state of mind as well.
wavs/06753.wav|The gods!
wavs/04913.wav|Don't think of me; I don't count any more.
wavs/04310.wav|Planes, of consciousness. Well, yes.
wavs/02356.wav|You did?
wavs/04942.wav|The first two years after the fall of Troy are now accounted for.
wavs/03308.wav|Do you still have any symptoms or complications from your complaints?
wavs/02575.wav|Well see
wavs/01696.wav|Were we at the same table? It's like
wavs/00326.wav|Alright now we smoke.
wavs/05295.wav|No LITTLE children to love me! A hot water bottle.
wavs/02896.wav|There was ice that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
wavs/03218.wav|How many episodes did you suffer in the last ten years?
wavs/00393.wav|Here you go kids. And then the peacock bit me.
wavs/05213.wav|I examined its mouth. I pocketed the slip of paper.
wavs/06271.wav|Till life became a Legend of the Dead.
wavs/03231.wav|Oh, sure. Absolutely. Go ahead. Well buddy
wavs/02677.wav|when I'll regret asking the following question, but. He's
wavs/01025.wav|Where are you going? I just have to go! Do I need a reason? I have things to do with my life.
wavs/03041.wav|I love you, but it's getting late now
wavs/06363.wav|Then I defy you, stars! I can't understand it, I repeat!
wavs/00830.wav|Well, now I actually have to get to work. Most likely. 
wavs/00905.wav|I don't know what Shelly told you about me, but
wavs/03915.wav|What do you do WITH the rest of it?
wavs/03165.wav|But we can prep the guy.
wavs/05401.wav|I am not going to Rome. The truth flashed upon me.
wavs/06673.wav|Then everything will be in order. She turned away.
wavs/03033.wav|I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. Do you think that was wrong?
wavs/05086.wav|Nineteen minutes, and five ships.
wavs/02687.wav|After all it is your ankle. Stat!
wavs/04996.wav|Our beads did not happen here to be in fashion.
wavs/03750.wav|But how does he know that the land sank?
wavs/01773.wav|There's something I've been meaning to tell you.
wavs/00287.wav|three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.
wavs/00650.wav|What type of activity do you take part in?
wavs/03299.wav|But you're more plugged into that show business thing. You know that's pretty good.
wavs/04871.wav|Spring had come. I saw beautiful women walking.
wavs/00860.wav|in an ideal world
wavs/01797.wav|I feel great.
wavs/03827.wav|Oh, I shall make a great thing of this.
wavs/01745.wav|What's an elf to do?
wavs/03211.wav|Yeah. I'll say, yeah.
wavs/04918.wav|Then how did it come to be in this state?
wavs/04576.wav|Why should I give you my goods for nothing?
wavs/06577.wav|I thought you were strangers to each other.
wavs/01170.wav|It was so nice having this little sink here. Give me a call when you get a chance. 
wavs/00576.wav|Miss more coffee?
wavs/06234.wav|Bassett tried new tactics. Locked away until death!
wavs/05338.wav|For the first TIME, life grows flat to me.
wavs/03548.wav|They did not look at the moonlight long. Joseph!
wavs/03505.wav|Had there been no liquor dispensing there had been no smashing.
wavs/00469.wav|Do you climb in any of these regions?
wavs/05956.wav|"Well, Mr. Land," asked the captain, "do you advise me to put the boats out to sea?" I have called her Emily.
wavs/05622.wav|Jerry took the glass and stood looking at her steadily.
wavs/05491.wav|The revolution broke out. You come after me!
wavs/06045.wav|It doesn't interest me a bit, Bruce! Penelope exclaimed.
wavs/00875.wav|I'll even let you ring the bell. We'll see you later. Bye! See you later!
wavs/05877.wav|But it has been known a long time that it is his plan.
wavs/00706.wav|It was comfortable and it was familiar. It was just nice.
wavs/01533.wav|Yes! You're not laughing now, are you, pal? All you needed were guys hitting each other with sticks.
wavs/01632.wav|Maybe she never got your message.
wavs/05961.wav|In Lima.
wavs/04974.wav|There were all kinds of uniforms. It was late when he left her.
wavs/06648.wav|They COULD always confess later.
wavs/06641.wav|It is horrible! No, no; I can't come.
wavs/04030.wav|Her head drooped lower on her bosom; her voice sunk as she answered me. "Yes," conceded Tom, "you have."
wavs/00762.wav|Okay. Okay. Okay. You know what? This is really expensive.
wavs/06561.wav|If I were, you would have been appointed.
wavs/01694.wav|How often have kidney stones been removed surgically?
wavs/04761.wav|These men became, as is well known, nearly all Liberals.
wavs/02107.wav|I see. You're gonna ask him to New Year's.
wavs/04537.wav|He had no such vast public as the modern philosopher has to reach.
wavs/05805.wav|I was found by them that did not seek me.
wavs/06238.wav|Then speak. His brothers, his sons, all his house walked in a spring sun.
wavs/05088.wav|Audrey! Yes; and you will be more so.
wavs/01566.wav|Do you still have complaints, problems in healing, other complaints or symptoms as the loss of the amputated part of the body?
wavs/05534.wav|The essential idea of an umbrella is breadth and protection.
wavs/01906.wav|Dinah?
wavs/03702.wav|I was there, and I saw it myself.
wavs/04507.wav|I tried to think that I was. Two mornings later, the door bell rang.
wavs/02673.wav|How's she doing?
wavs/04471.wav|Has the change to this place helped you?
wavs/00866.wav|Hey I might. I'm sorry.
wavs/00637.wav|The first time didn't count. You know, it was Barry.
wavs/05274.wav|We will consume a few without FASHIONABLE improvements.
wavs/02150.wav|I don't think I can be involved in this family thing. Oh, my God! Look at that.
wavs/02233.wav|What kind of stuff? What's the matter?
wavs/04143.wav|Must the good one perish in this fashion?
wavs/05639.wav|Now and then he glanced at Delight's bent head.
wavs/02606.wav|Seriously what's the part? Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in! 
wavs/04484.wav|I do not know whether she will be happy with you or not.
wavs/03379.wav|He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber.
wavs/04807.wav|I spoke three times to audiences that night.
wavs/06827.wav|I NEVER could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with him.
wavs/01200.wav|During the last five years which respiratory tract complaints have you or did you suffer from?
wavs/05803.wav|The girl raised her head quickly. Vernon could not but have perceived him!
wavs/03463.wav|That's why I threw his watch out of the window.
wavs/03986.wav|Do evil feelings bring men to the same result as talents?
wavs/01667.wav|that means she didn't get her messages yet.
wavs/00069.wav|Does it still hurt? Yeah.
wavs/06078.wav|With cause, he may challenge as many as he has cause to challenge.
wavs/05388.wav|I don't care a bit.
wavs/00509.wav|Yes, absolutely. Saturday night, all rules apply. What are you saying? I should shave again? Pick up some wine?
wavs/06591.wav|They waited UNTIL he was in position just before them.
wavs/01093.wav|but, like, when I'm cooking naked. You cook naked?
wavs/03331.wav|Please state the current degree of visual impairment right eye
wavs/04665.wav|The answer, if there was one, is not reported.
wavs/02184.wav|Are you under regular review with your doctor?
wavs/02348.wav|What restrictions do you suffer from?
wavs/05227.wav|Their manners and their laws and way of living Shall all be Greek.
wavs/01198.wav|I'm sorry I can't do this. Can't do it. We loved him.
wavs/04276.wav|The Genoese, bowing, stepped backward from the table.
wavs/01527.wav|these. Bullwinkle socks.
wavs/03416.wav|Are not you big enough to dress your own self?
wavs/06751.wav|On the nobles the Manifesto made a very different impression.
wavs/05741.wav|You do not know what it is to write. Let him despise me!
wavs/03462.wav|Will you let me consult him for you?
wavs/00004.wav|I could! I could do it!
wavs/05641.wav|What torches glare and glisten Upon the swords and armor of these men?
wavs/05314.wav|The children all sat down, and Balthazar, astonished, remained standing before the fireplace.
wavs/05136.wav|I banished the sound and immediately I found myself enjoying the pretty scenery.
wavs/00344.wav|Do you still suffer from symptoms or complaints caused by your disorder?
wavs/03213.wav|I'll tell you what. You buy me a soda and we're even. Okay?
wavs/02959.wav|Mole or freckle that has required medical attention?
wavs/01209.wav|Not so much! Okay. No. Give it to me.
wavs/05661.wav|See Amanda WITH her coat.
wavs/01561.wav|Then I don't get it. You're, Like, the guy in the big office.
wavs/00957.wav|to simulate these conditions. I have a question then.
wavs/05298.wav|Around him all the elements of revolution crystallized.
wavs/03591.wav|Their estimate of time is almost invariably wrong. But he couldn't fight against them.
wavs/06382.wav|By and by it will set behind the hills.
wavs/00862.wav|just to see if I was okay? I mean, how needy is that? I'm sorry! That is it!
wavs/05386.wav|Intellectual smartness and abstract rational deductions entice you.
wavs/01042.wav|When did you last travel there?
wavs/02236.wav|Do you have or have you ever had symptoms
wavs/04334.wav|It's a freehold, by George!
wavs/01758.wav|So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
wavs/04401.wav|The Government understood this as well as the parties; the most insignificant BOURGEOIS felt it.
wavs/04191.wav|I want air and liberty: let me go forth! Let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already indicated.
wavs/01772.wav|I'll be right back.
wavs/01263.wav|What do you think? Lots of things. Which one is she? May I help you?
wavs/00293.wav|No plans, huh? Not a one! Right right. Shut up.
wavs/00689.wav|And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
wavs/01109.wav|Because they are.
wavs/00697.wav|he touches himself when nobody's watching.
wavs/01077.wav|I never really noticed. Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it. Yeah she is.
wavs/03446.wav|He put this unique copy under his arm, and went out.
wavs/05790.wav|Many of the operatic stars have given very interesting accounts of their experiences.
wavs/00991.wav|Yes! I know exactly what you mean. He can be really smooth.
wavs/01981.wav|Why don't you tell them?
wavs/06334.wav|If the Admiral came not again it was the one thing to do.
wavs/00461.wav|Oh my God! It's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb
wavs/02099.wav|Fantastic! One question: How is that possible?
wavs/04065.wav|In training for a contest an athlete usually takes long runs.
wavs/03497.wav|I think that there is a good deal in what you say, Socrates.
wavs/04605.wav|Mrs. Flushing was the exception.
wavs/00701.wav|But I just want
wavs/06696.wav|There is still a chance. There are three inns in London.
wavs/02568.wav|I was laughing. You made me laugh! Oh my God! There he is! There he is!
wavs/01456.wav|me.
wavs/05781.wav|Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.
wavs/03489.wav|Oh, with some, I suppose; since some of them turn into excellent men. His children?
wavs/01631.wav|Yeah, because otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
wavs/01058.wav|Yeah, my neighbor. Yeah, the brunette.
wavs/03833.wav|And I want you, always, to remember this.
wavs/05536.wav|Nobody knows. Certainly you have not made my life pleasant to me of late.
wavs/03127.wav|Which kind of recreational drugs?
wavs/01955.wav|And it was at night
wavs/00972.wav|Don't tell me what's in it. The diet starts tomorrow. You remember Janice.
wavs/00771.wav|Who doesn't Like me? Everyone.
wavs/00264.wav|What type of disorder do you have?
wavs/06524.wav|I wish our morals were sounder in such matters.
wavs/06724.wav|Trace him?
wavs/04528.wav|Oh, a straw ride! With this we close.
wavs/05235.wav|Once more he came back to the wicket. She will hear.
wavs/03031.wav|I'm sorry. God, I am so sorry.
wavs/04473.wav|Jean grunted.
wavs/06294.wav|See how she loved her husband. We must somehow have mistaken our bearings.
wavs/06182.wav|What spirit was that? There was sound reason back of it.
wavs/01171.wav|I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart. Now, come on. Get out of my way.
wavs/03666.wav|"It is no bed of roses," I said; "but what act of Parliament was there that I should be happy?"
wavs/01970.wav|Pass it! Pass it!
wavs/05008.wav|It is about my uncle's usual time. But how did you find out?
wavs/02739.wav|but I feel that if I can do this
wavs/01629.wav|I'm glad you're here.
wavs/04112.wav|The hill slope carried an enormous forest on its back.
wavs/02962.wav|I remember the moonlight coming in the window, and her face had the most
wavs/05844.wav|I stepped lightly to one of the PUBLIC desks.
wavs/02331.wav|No. Actually he's smiling. Oh my God! Don't do that!
wavs/01551.wav|What age did you first suffer from this condition?
wavs/02664.wav|Oh you're not going? Oh
wavs/00575.wav|Which other type of mountaineering do you practice?
wavs/03110.wav|Tell me why you did this again? Big guy?
wavs/05937.wav|His patience was in some danger of FAILING him.
wavs/03220.wav|What are your responsibilities as key person?
wavs/01976.wav|Thank you. No actually
wavs/06706.wav|For a moment she paused to recover her composure.
wavs/01621.wav|just for the hell of it. More or less.
wavs/04164.wav|She put one arm round his neck, and fixed her eyes on his.
wavs/01564.wav|There's really no easy way to say this.
wavs/03812.wav|I can almost think I have come back again to my former self.
wavs/04147.wav|I think that is what the man said.
wavs/03789.wav|Moreover, they LAVISHED a thousand cares on their scholars.
wavs/00974.wav|I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman. She'll scratch your eyes out.
wavs/06674.wav|There are lots of snipe; and there are grouse too.
wavs/05265.wav|I smiled as I saw his next move.
wavs/01464.wav|Uh oh the laundry's done.
wavs/01445.wav|Come on show me. Everything's pink?
wavs/04768.wav|Then he drew himself up.
wavs/04100.wav|He gives all he has to the poor and sick.
wavs/05252.wav|Let her ALONE, lady; as she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.
wavs/01785.wav|Overall how many time have you had symptoms?
wavs/02043.wav|I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian.
wavs/03244.wav|What competitions do you take part in? In the last two years, how many events have you participated in?
wavs/04437.wav|But I got something to tell you, Mister Man.
wavs/06296.wav|The Lord increase this business!
wavs/01612.wav|How about you? Good. Good. Listen
wavs/02760.wav|and we'll eat ice cream. Okay. It's a pear shaped diamond
wavs/03522.wav|You shall be severely punished.
wavs/02591.wav|I didn't have anything on that topic.
wavs/01421.wav|I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't. Oh, Monica, come on. You do cool things.
wavs/01737.wav|Do you still have symptoms or complications from your disorder?
wavs/01006.wav|One might wonder. A glass is on the table. There's no coaster.
wavs/00523.wav|When was the diagnosis made?
wavs/00668.wav|I'll take it. No, darling.
wavs/04224.wav|A few hours had sufficed to bring THIS about.
wavs/06153.wav|But what will become of her country if she kill all the babies?
wavs/04158.wav|By your help, Socrates. His eyes softened instantly.
wavs/05477.wav|She looked away from him to the Prince.
wavs/01842.wav|Look I shouldn't have come.
wavs/02801.wav|Well yeah
wavs/03537.wav|And if fair words fail?
wavs/04581.wav|The cautious Baron suggests setting the prisoner free.
wavs/03804.wav|You will frighten him if he sees you like that.
wavs/05475.wav|He turned to me, quite calm, with a ghastly smile.
wavs/04175.wav|But the supreme confidence so strangely felt that night admitted no such blunders.
wavs/04093.wav|It ALMOST made a snort.
wavs/04250.wav|I will be here at any hour you will name.
wavs/03024.wav|How long are you in the city? Two days. I got a job midtown.
wavs/02073.wav|Oh, look! It's the woman we ordered. Can we help you?
wavs/01944.wav|What's that curry taste? Curry.
wavs/01804.wav|Where you going? A birthday party with some work people.
wavs/05187.wav|But I have not the least INCLINATION to go near her.
wavs/02983.wav|Do you remember how your father used to be?
wavs/03803.wav|Even the children were gone. There's nothing to say.
wavs/02696.wav|to avoid touching. Not in a good way.
wavs/00417.wav|Why? How much will this cost? What'll we do? There's not much we can do.
wavs/05416.wav|Are you alluding to your health? What talk is this?
wavs/00041.wav|Never. What are you talking about?
wavs/05900.wav|I bundled it into the other seat of my Humming Bird, and started back.
wavs/01813.wav|Or who I'm dating. Ready for the check? God, yes.
wavs/04271.wav|They ranged themselves in the plain before him in the form of a circle.
wavs/03449.wav|I closed the window. Can you open it? I am going to enlist.
wavs/05212.wav|Our forefathers had their own ways of accounting for each of these calamities.
wavs/01310.wav|And yet it did. What's going on? Oh my God!
wavs/05306.wav|It was as rotten as tinder, apparently with extreme age.
wavs/01232.wav|you are luminous with a kind of delicate grace. Then that's when you started yelling.
wavs/00196.wav|It's just you know
wavs/05627.wav|It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton.
wavs/05171.wav|I would much rather have been merry than wise.
wavs/06085.wav|Like the rabbits, the beavers had become shy.
wavs/05168.wav|Merry Christmas! Still another resemblance between Paris and the sea.
wavs/06096.wav|I do not care to seek them. Sheer outrage made Anna's face pale.
wavs/05573.wav|They said, To persuade you to go back with us.
wavs/02610.wav|they don't see all of the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.
wavs/00620.wav|Then you haven't.
wavs/06476.wav|They were with me in the better moments of these my worst days.
wavs/04512.wav|You desire me, but you do not love me.
wavs/02237.wav|Since when are you disabled or you have had a degree of disability?
wavs/03844.wav|And whither Naomi would, thither they had wandered, without object and without direction.
wavs/05276.wav|I have not been accustomed to such language as this.
wavs/04816.wav|Our political system remains with but little change. These are two celebrated ones.
wavs/03471.wav|I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation.
wavs/02553.wav|Do you suffer from any other disorders or consequences such as
wavs/04086.wav|What could he be thinking of? Very well, Mr. Dunbar.
wavs/06695.wav|It rests entirely with your experience to show me how.
wavs/01127.wav|What? We're just friends.
wavs/00778.wav|No, I am sorry. I'm sorry.
wavs/05865.wav|She brushed the suggestion aside with a little shiver.
wavs/02733.wav|you're gonna have to take me with it! Yes! Did you see that?
wavs/02907.wav|and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did,
wavs/03405.wav|Yes, I'm glad you rode Out. That means yes, you know.
wavs/00327.wav|What is the duration of treatment for each attack?
wavs/00415.wav|Fine. Now you'll never know.
wavs/04037.wav|Gentlemen! Only he does not like the title.
wavs/04821.wav|You can't dare me! The hour now is; come, assemble!
wavs/01360.wav|Which type of diving do you do?
wavs/04305.wav|Josephine blew her nose; the cab was dreadfully stuffy.
wavs/05571.wav|I sure hope she's here.
wavs/00773.wav|That's pretty much it. But you tell it really well, sweetie. Thanks. Okay.
wavs/06506.wav|Do you WANT traces of his fury? I have three sons.
wavs/01900.wav|On average how long do you have symptoms for during each episode?
wavs/03374.wav|The doctors were the authorities on this subject.
wavs/02490.wav|Have you been treated by your physician because of your symptoms?
wavs/01325.wav|Please state the net profit over the last three years
wavs/00967.wav|Waiter? One more plate of chicken wings over here. Here's the thing. We're different.
wavs/05963.wav|For that matter, I would do the like.
wavs/05856.wav|We have really lived in a little world of our own.
wavs/05996.wav|He smiled as his nephew came slowly towards him.
wavs/03607.wav|Renunciation; why? The only trouble is that you have not your instruments here.
wavs/00330.wav|Which has nothing to do with it, except that I found out today. Things have changed here on Walton's mountain.
wavs/02635.wav|Where did you work in the past please provide periods?
wavs/05046.wav|Barker took up his hat with some stiffness and moved toward the door.
wavs/00533.wav|But if you have to ask.
wavs/00888.wav|I was just saying Speak up.
wavs/05526.wav|And with that claim on you, you keep her waiting?
wavs/03473.wav|For, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.
wavs/01506.wav|you can count the change in my pocket?
wavs/01023.wav|How often occur the symptoms overall?
wavs/03701.wav|I read every word. Was it a blessing?
wavs/00378.wav|I don't have to prove anything. I'm gonna go get them. But then everyone will know.
wavs/04055.wav|Then they spoke. He loosened his grasp and turned away from her also.
wavs/03612.wav|He's easy.
wavs/03825.wav|It certainly was not her portrait. She complained of faintness.
wavs/03355.wav|Then he glided like a snake through the reeds, the grass, the ferns.
wavs/03357.wav|But I can't LEAVE mother.
wavs/03721.wav|One is forced to neglect a few opportunities!
wavs/04962.wav|Keep your eye on it.
wavs/03259.wav|I mean what the hell is that thing?
wavs/03830.wav|I am a party interested. Her ill is inscrutable.
wavs/02358.wav|Why don't I just join you both there?
wavs/00374.wav|Hey that was really good! Thanks! Let's keep going.
wavs/05220.wav|So we were satisfied to be paid twice a month.
wavs/04738.wav|A flash lit it for us, then another and another.
wavs/03029.wav|They had horses and rabbits to chase.
wavs/05756.wav|A week since, two noteworthy persons had died in Rome on the same day.
wavs/06738.wav|Some characters represent syllables. You could choose which you liked!
wavs/05986.wav|When shall I see you again? When will it change colour?
wavs/01168.wav|Are you guys gonna be okay? Hey hey we'll be fine.
wavs/03295.wav|Can I use your phone? So she's a woman so what?
wavs/01996.wav|He's smart, sophisticated, and he has a real job. Come on! We were great together.
wavs/01748.wav|I can't call her. I left a message. I have some pride.
wavs/02454.wav|No don't do this! I don't have to prove anything. I'm gonna get them.
wavs/02526.wav|Really? He does? Hey buddy! What's up?
wavs/01219.wav|We can do it tomorrow night.
wavs/04534.wav|I feel as if my own hand might fly up and strike me.
wavs/06420.wav|Come, if you're going home, I'll walk by your side.
wavs/03392.wav|Don't let your natural indignation carry you away!
wavs/01428.wav|It's just that that's not why we bought the ticket. We're in the car, fighting traffic, just trying to stay awake.
wavs/02064.wav|Were the stones present in both kidneys?
wavs/06757.wav|Thirty thousand pounds to forget the little I have learned!
wavs/06513.wav|He immediately set out in pursuit of the thief, whose whereabouts were soon determined.
wavs/01317.wav|and they brought you in and gave you to me.
wavs/06608.wav|It was probably the unusual that affected him.
wavs/05621.wav|Oh, have I not a right to a terrible vengeance?
wavs/01789.wav|Can we start throwing things in? Yeah, okay! Okay. Barry's letters.
wavs/03148.wav|That's festive. Guys, there's somebody I'd like you to meet.
wavs/00641.wav|What activities do you do under water?
wavs/00193.wav|Last night, you seemed to know your way around the table.
wavs/02122.wav|Which one of us are you talking to there?
wavs/00157.wav|Which symptoms do you currently have?
wavs/06199.wav|It was as if she suffered false imprisonment.
wavs/06236.wav|It shoots low and fast down the line.
wavs/05617.wav|After proceeding a few paces, I received no reply when I spoke: I perceived that my brother was no longer with me.
wavs/03916.wav|Darling mother, open the door!
wavs/06357.wav|Then and there Venters found it imperative to postpone work for the present.
wavs/02516.wav|if they never get to meet the guy. Do you all promise?
wavs/04358.wav|He kissed her again and let her go.
wavs/06553.wav|Of course you were here last Saturday evening?
wavs/05352.wav|No, I should not advise them about that.
wavs/02250.wav|In which activities do you participate?
wavs/06647.wav|Never be afraid of HIM. It's like the rot there is in tracts.
wavs/04434.wav|Good business. Just at that moment Marion rushed in.
wavs/03377.wav|She bowed her head. Inspector Jacks was silent.
wavs/01351.wav|I can't Look nice? There are doctors there. What is that? For the ride.
wavs/05033.wav|He wished now he'd turned off the light. She was raised in Vermont.
wavs/00331.wav|Wait, wait. What's with you? I just grabbed a spoon.
wavs/03698.wav|Alexander Abraham growled again. Come with the youngest dawn!
wavs/00186.wav|because you don't wanna start the year with me if you can't finish it.
wavs/00403.wav|It is! It is!
wavs/01406.wav|And so I
wavs/06132.wav|"You beast," I said, "this is half your doing."
wavs/06347.wav|Teresa was scarce gone when Pietro returned with his picture, looking black as thunder.
wavs/02798.wav|And you should
wavs/02074.wav|If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want world peace
wavs/03318.wav|Oh God
wavs/01495.wav|The restaurant called. They wanna know if you're showing up for work.
wavs/06410.wav|It's disgraceful!
wavs/01705.wav|That's different!
wavs/06697.wav|Their intellectual defects are patent. Lucien was at this pass.
wavs/01066.wav|You miss it? No not so much.
wavs/06102.wav|And Count Octave is attending the funeral in person.
wavs/02618.wav|Can I ask you guys a question?
wavs/06112.wav|We have been such good friends. The mother and the son went out.
wavs/01986.wav|I don't see why not.
wavs/06082.wav|Ryan was accredited with being one of the best prisoners in the penitentiary.
wavs/05189.wav|She must be a pretty sort of a woman.
wavs/06306.wav|Nay, Lady, the damsel whom I seek is not my beloved, but my friend.
wavs/01491.wav|That sounds right. Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
wavs/06698.wav|I don't know so much as I could wish.
wavs/05998.wav|Be pleased to consider this letter as strictly confidential between yourself and me.
wavs/04508.wav|Tell them they're luxuries. It is as you say.
wavs/02810.wav|My eyes! My eyes! I warned you.
wavs/00211.wav|Have you suffered from any complications after or during the surgery?
wavs/05115.wav|This alarmed, but fortunately did not irritate him.
wavs/00751.wav|Do you exercise your winter sport activity in any of these regions?
wavs/05037.wav|You other Jews waiting in all lands for your Messiah!
wavs/03040.wav|well that's true
wavs/03081.wav|It was my first time.
wavs/01503.wav|incredible glow. The moon, the glow, the magical feeling. You did this.
wavs/03085.wav|There's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together.
wavs/04699.wav|The crop of hops promises to be very large.
wavs/00638.wav|You know
wavs/02115.wav|Because you see
wavs/00432.wav|What is or was the cause for your disorder or complaints?
wavs/00503.wav|Sorry.
wavs/06319.wav|He fetched her out, and they disappeared from my neighbourhood.
wavs/03249.wav|We're gonna take a short break.
wavs/01779.wav|for three guys like us.
wavs/06762.wav|Don't you realize what you've just said? The rest of you lads stand clear.
wavs/00740.wav|that you use your humor to keep people at a distance. I mean, I just met you. I don't know you from Adam.
wavs/00099.wav|Your dad's in love. The worst part is, it's with two different women.
wavs/05113.wav|And silver light was on the open stream.
wavs/02726.wav|Yes. But there's a rat problem.
wavs/03723.wav|Amanda Gill, have you gone stark staring mad?
wavs/04463.wav|I will take them out as quick as a wink.
wavs/05040.wav|Oh, Marta! Come again after six days. Distribution of duties in the Commission.
wavs/00199.wav|This is what I'm doing now. Waitressing? I write the specials on the specials board.
wavs/06001.wav|Suppose I'm wrong! Balthazar had dwindled from his true self.
wavs/01393.wav|Sorry. I don't know how I feel about him. Let me figure it out.
wavs/06317.wav|It was open, and two or three small kernels were still in it.
wavs/01655.wav|You keep saying that, but there's something right here. I love you. I love you too.
wavs/03773.wav|But it turned out to be not obscurity in which Miss Austen sinned.
wavs/01268.wav|Hey look
wavs/04480.wav|Pharaoh ordered his pursuit, but it was in vain.
wavs/02392.wav|Oh that is so sick!
wavs/02522.wav|who am I going to ask? If I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
wavs/04233.wav|We examined with interest the letter, and the fine linen.
wavs/05022.wav|"It is certainly an unpleasant thing," replied Mr. Dashwood, "to have those kind of yearly drains on one's income."
wavs/03676.wav|I should like to enlist him. Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
wavs/03649.wav|Dear Lizzy!
wavs/04944.wav|No, no, dear Uncle, we will not punish the poor boy any further.
wavs/06130.wav|It was a snap at nothing, and missed.
wavs/01583.wav|Please indicate the area
wavs/04318.wav|Prove me, my gracious lord.
wavs/00561.wav|You just barge in here and you don't knock? You have no respect for my privacy?
wavs/03689.wav|I will give him one of My days.
wavs/06447.wav|They'll get all they need, the chances are.
wavs/00292.wav|Okay.
wavs/03734.wav|When you have your stories and images in place, arrange for your references.
wavs/05076.wav|Feels like it was full of gold bricks.
wavs/01998.wav|Yeah, but there were no suds. So? You know, no suds, no save. No suds, no Excuse me.
wavs/04569.wav|Now, tell me, can we come to an understanding?
wavs/02346.wav|What not work out? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
wavs/04664.wav|The next event in the series might fairly be called phenomenal. Unworthy chains?
wavs/04572.wav|Can you for a moment doubt my sincerity or my character?
wavs/04630.wav|Is this to be endured!
wavs/05548.wav|But I think you have something else in your mind.
wavs/01992.wav|I want you here so I can keep an eye on you.
wavs/04048.wav|And as their captain, so their pride doth grow.
wavs/02661.wav|What'll you do? If you tried that on my birthday
wavs/00364.wav|Which other activities do you do when diving?
wavs/01414.wav|No, what's wrong? Come on. Okay. It's nothing. I'm fine. It's just It's my friends.
wavs/02519.wav|Some days it's all I can think about. What did I say?
wavs/05302.wav|And there came a ripping, crashing report. It must be done!
wavs/01437.wav|Good for you. Yeah it is.
wavs/05940.wav|But he knows nothing, suspects nothing of it.
wavs/00348.wav|But you're really bringing the party down. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, okay.
wavs/02498.wav|Be a man. Just stop calling.
wavs/00347.wav|I should go.
wavs/02350.wav|When did you last have these symptoms?
wavs/04442.wav|A bride?
wavs/02995.wav|I wouldn't want to be there when the laughter stops. What did you mean by that?
wavs/04083.wav|Any artificial product, or workmanship.
wavs/00619.wav|How could we resist? That's great!
wavs/02866.wav|Sorry l
wavs/05166.wav|Pooh, she does too! Other indications cropped up.
wavs/00218.wav|Look I know he's not perfect. But the truth is at the end of the day
wavs/02558.wav|I'll never forget you.
wavs/05459.wav|And so you've regularly come into the business, Master George?
wavs/01919.wav|How often do you suffer from headaches or migraine?
wavs/03726.wav|We don't wait on customers unless they ask us to.
wavs/06076.wav|I have heard something that will give you pleasure.
wavs/06824.wav|His blessing. I nodded, for I could not speak, and then began the ascent.
wavs/05192.wav|Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.
wavs/03519.wav|I cannot, for the task would be too disgusting!
wavs/06779.wav|She hesitated, glanced, bit her lip, and resigned herself.
wavs/01150.wav|She was my best friend you guys. We went to camp together
wavs/04520.wav|But we'd like Mr. Strickland to see it.
wavs/05949.wav|In the first PLACE: What is a liar? If you doubt, wait and try me.
wavs/02157.wav|You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
wavs/03850.wav|Have you not the intention which I attribute to you?
wavs/00802.wav|What happened? I don't know. I mean
wavs/02286.wav|Okay. A month ago, I wanted to hurt you more than I've ever wanted to.
wavs/03740.wav|It is dear, but I want it. Now ain't some people jest odd!
wavs/06405.wav|A mayor does not offer his hand to a police spy.
wavs/02918.wav|So I thought I'd come down here and make sure you were okay.
wavs/01836.wav|Please specify complications
wavs/02132.wav|And I realize that I'm the one who's suppose to catch him, right?
wavs/03430.wav|The Crows were all in a fury. Slaughter!
wavs/03028.wav|Why can't we just have what we have now?
wavs/00145.wav|Here's the thing. We're different.
wavs/00012.wav|with them tomorrow.
wavs/06722.wav|The city was under naval control, the German Governor being a naval officer.
wavs/03370.wav|I'd feel better if you'd let me, honest I would!
wavs/02851.wav|Since when are you self employed?
wavs/03774.wav|Great stuff.
wavs/00723.wav|Change. Sit down. Two seconds.
wavs/05778.wav|Vernon, no!
wavs/05732.wav|The boy whose buttons are FARTHEST from "jack" of course gets the last and least opportunity.
wavs/01435.wav|How are you?
wavs/02251.wav|Which position do you hold?
wavs/05532.wav|That's what they're there for.
wavs/06037.wav|We divided games with service with monotonous regularity.
wavs/01181.wav|Are you through with that?
wavs/00271.wav|Got me. Yeah let's see.
wavs/04114.wav|But I shook it off.
wavs/00850.wav|Brooklyn Heights. Cleveland.
wavs/02325.wav|No don't say it.
wavs/04746.wav|Even his voice was altered when he spoke next.
wavs/05538.wav|About five hundred volumes have been well and neatly unrolled.
wavs/00993.wav|You have Paolo. You don't have to face the pressure
wavs/06439.wav|It looked a happier party than it was. Find what I owe, Watson.
wavs/00755.wav|Has a malignant tumour been diagnosed?
wavs/00103.wav|and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn
wavs/00082.wav|Good morning dear. You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
wavs/05705.wav|I congratulate you warmly. Only three hands were held up.
wavs/02124.wav|I was weak. I couldn't help myself. Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much.
wavs/01131.wav|Well she's not quite. What?
wavs/06252.wav|This society is Olympus. But oh, how to profit by it!
wavs/00759.wav|How you doing?
wavs/01076.wav|Hi. Hi. You look great. I hate that.
wavs/04880.wav|This came of breaking the Law. Taxes swallow up everything.
wavs/00060.wav|Stop it stop it
wavs/03155.wav|When did you stop drinking?
wavs/03650.wav|You don't know Indians the way I know them.
wavs/05229.wav|This babble shall not henceforth trouble me. The others have been married off.
wavs/03815.wav|Becky has the other one.
wavs/01227.wav|I made a man with eyes of coal
wavs/05426.wav|Another little stream of callers had come into the room.
wavs/01480.wav|If it helps I could slide over.
wavs/03611.wav|Graham flushed.
wavs/04003.wav|She nodded towards the fragment on the grass.
wavs/05422.wav|Besides what the grim wolf WITH privy paw Daily devours apace, and nothing said.
wavs/03775.wav|You can't accept! Now I am going to tell the truth. At last his martyrdom approaches: he is led to prison.
wavs/03524.wav|I advertised for a partner to join a man who had plenty of capital.
wavs/02031.wav|What other symptoms do you have?
wavs/05502.wav|He seemed to be studying with all his might.
wavs/00427.wav|Beside the surgery did you have any futher therapy?
wavs/03902.wav|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
wavs/04994.wav|The moment you open your hand, you will sleep.
wavs/02376.wav|Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a nip.
wavs/02462.wav|Which diving qualification and education do you have?
wavs/06293.wav|Verona.
wavs/02155.wav|No. Okay Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
wavs/02405.wav|No, I am sorry. I'm sorry. Oh my.
wavs/00389.wav|he's so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive. He's been more loving. It's like every day is our anniversary.
wavs/00653.wav|You know, it was actually really great.
wavs/04032.wav|It lasted but a moment.
wavs/03787.wav|The engine was splashed with mud and soaking wet.
wavs/00238.wav|Please describe your complications
wavs/03933.wav|Vernon cried, and took the stile at a vault.
wavs/00953.wav|I got it. Maybe.
wavs/00853.wav|Do you still suffer from your complaints?
wavs/00262.wav|Well do I have to?
wavs/06596.wav|These events all belong frankly to the realm of fairyland. Making the Propeller.
wavs/04177.wav|The latter entered. Winding veils round their heads, the women walked on deck.
wavs/04756.wav|"He will be very entertaining," said Corey, "if you start him on his paint." She was last seen at one in the morning. She had evidently not rested on her bed.
wavs/04352.wav|She stayed out until the night fell and the stars appeared.
wavs/02336.wav|I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.
wavs/03755.wav|It is he. Sanders perceived it, and asked me down into the cabin.
wavs/06086.wav|And in the way you carry YOUR clothes.
wavs/01331.wav|Please specify exact disorders referred to
wavs/02788.wav|Anxiety, depression or any mental illness that's required treatment or counselling or chronic fatigue syndrome?
wavs/02797.wav|And I take the dead flowers out of the vase.
wavs/06117.wav|And he stared at Marius intently with his epic effrontery.
wavs/05175.wav|It was such a relief to be ABLE to tell somebody.
wavs/02838.wav|Why isn't she calling? Maybe she never got your message. Call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps
wavs/06604.wav|How now, madam! In vain!
wavs/03319.wav|Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice. Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
wavs/04438.wav|And now we must come to the narration.
wavs/01762.wav|and then he's this little thing I can't get off my leg. Isn't there any way to keep him?
wavs/02200.wav|No matter what I do, I'm still gonna be a father.
wavs/05303.wav|O Richard!
wavs/03848.wav|We have been preserved, these many years, in peace and prosperity.
wavs/04708.wav|But quite alone. A servant. I will obey you, Penelope.
wavs/06792.wav|The darling!
wavs/04700.wav|She knew them well. It has been proved too often.
wavs/06275.wav|After summer merrily: Merrily, merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
wavs/02556.wav|This is so exciting!
wavs/06111.wav|She is quite a swell. Ha, wait a bit!
wavs/05208.wav|In Boston they understand each other with very few words said.
wavs/00978.wav|Yeah she is.
wavs/04202.wav|She can do all sorts of things, and likes to be doing them.
wavs/02499.wav|Has a percentage of disability been established?
wavs/03585.wav|Then the one always both is and becomes older and younger than itself?
wavs/03290.wav|I'll meet someone else. There'll be other Alans.
wavs/00411.wav|Did you have any lung function tests?
wavs/00713.wav|Oh you do
wavs/05307.wav|They rode toward Santa Fe, and I followed on foot.
wavs/00152.wav|What are you gonna be? One of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, you know?
wavs/03013.wav|Yeah it's interesting.
wavs/00067.wav|What is your average diving depth?
wavs/03209.wav|there. Instead of That's right!
wavs/05389.wav|She SEIZED the candle and went up into her room.
wavs/00536.wav|as long as we're telling stuff
wavs/06310.wav|Let me take a look!
wavs/05871.wav|I handed him the paper.
wavs/00446.wav|Do you ride you bike for pleasure only?
wavs/02427.wav|Where do you go to?
wavs/06266.wav|He presented to the Admiral some gold and precious stones.
wavs/00662.wav|Okay, come here. I hate this. Thank you. I love you. I'm gonna need a new set of these forms.
wavs/06512.wav|My neck and throat hurt. Sir Joseph was quite right.
wavs/02002.wav|Oh God. Surprise!
wavs/06247.wav|Hamel turned up his coat collar as he walked and shivered a little.
wavs/04676.wav|I'll tell you, Jane. He hath always been good and gracious to me: and no place alters it.
wavs/02387.wav|I can't make a decision. Just Okay. Stay. Stay. Stay.
wavs/00910.wav|Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back. I need help!
wavs/01063.wav|When did the immunotherapy treatment finish?
wavs/02212.wav|How often did you suffer from your disorder in the last five years?
wavs/05769.wav|What will they do here?
wavs/06408.wav|He had the right to be killed in that barricade.
wavs/00030.wav|that I made that you loved so much? Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
wavs/06525.wav|Would there were nine and sixty more. Oh, it is true, it is true!
wavs/01145.wav|There's more beer right?
wavs/03137.wav|How often do your symptoms occur?
wavs/04999.wav|What does Mrs. Rook matter? I heard of it.
wavs/02239.wav|Was the mole malignant?
wavs/01997.wav|And a power tie? No, pretty much just a towel.
wavs/04074.wav|Tom Swift.
wavs/02349.wav|Which further deformations do you suffer from?
wavs/05676.wav|But you're not, are you?
wavs/01403.wav|I think it's nicer when people just get along.
wavs/02446.wav|Notice, no fear. No sense of impending doom.
wavs/03265.wav|I should get to see who she is. You're kind of losing it here. This is becoming a weird obsession.
wavs/06270.wav|On the Physical Basis of Life. If one has being, it is all things.
wavs/02974.wav|Have you undergone surgery?
wavs/06685.wav|Did you know Enoch Arden of this town?
wavs/01106.wav|How are you? How did you know I was here?
wavs/05483.wav|This settles it right here.
wavs/04894.wav|They parted.
wavs/05014.wav|The echo of the forest to the axe.
wavs/02514.wav|new. No that's not exactly what I was
wavs/04243.wav|All that may be solely the fault of these young men.
wavs/00377.wav|Do you still have ongoing symptoms or complaints?
wavs/04380.wav|You are concerned in this vile slander, too.
wavs/04687.wav|How came you to know Gerard, our son?
wavs/01866.wav|Oh please.
wavs/02407.wav|None of the bullets hit the engine block
wavs/04195.wav|The time is gone for robbing him alive, and I must murder him.
wavs/01452.wav|You never told me your age.
wavs/00001.wav|You're right. We saw your head.
wavs/00192.wav|But what do you say we just put that aside for now.
wavs/01083.wav|I'm taking some classes with you, and I was wondering what they were. I've had a recent head injury and certain numbers
wavs/00136.wav|Tell me it's you and me we.
wavs/00896.wav|It's romantic. Really?
wavs/02152.wav|So how'd it go? I didn't get the job. He's not even jolly. It's all political.
wavs/02935.wav|You really think so? I really do.
wavs/01000.wav|I just can't stand your friends. That was fun.
wavs/04491.wav|It is an ineffable solace, to feel that this burden is shared by others.
wavs/00140.wav|In the last five years, which of the following conditions have you been diagnosed with?
wavs/03958.wav|It was the day the dream came true.
wavs/06002.wav|He had HARDLY finished when a loud noise became audible on the staircase.
wavs/00391.wav|Is the loan conditional upon the issue of this policy?
wavs/04873.wav|Few English students make this voyage of exploration.
wavs/00255.wav|Really? I'm sure.
wavs/03077.wav|Can you believe she actually thought that? When I first met you, I thought maybe
wavs/06143.wav|He's in the engine room getting dry now.
wavs/02671.wav|Admit it, all things considered, you had fun tonight. The kid has it. The kid
wavs/04368.wav|We should, I can assure you, do our very best to entertain you.
wavs/05226.wav|There was a crush. Time to give her a call.
wavs/00726.wav|it was the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf. Hey kids.
wavs/00844.wav|Will he know what this is in reference to?
wavs/02931.wav|so you'd know I wasn't always such a terrible guy. I don't know.
wavs/00687.wav|What is your actual diagnosis?
wavs/00224.wav|Don't go. Okay.
wavs/00565.wav|You are?
wavs/04786.wav|Shall I see you again, I wonder, Mr. Hamel?
wavs/05336.wav|Ah, you are all silent!
wavs/00604.wav|What joints is or are involved?
wavs/05828.wav|Rules, principles and standards die and vanish every day.
wavs/06567.wav|Whose?
wavs/02641.wav|I like that better. The usher gave me this to give to you.
wavs/04348.wav|Now hear our English king; For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
wavs/03763.wav|It was a long shot for a revolver: nevertheless it took effect. The last is in many cases difficult, but not impossible.
wavs/06157.wav|My mind was prepared for anything by this time.
wavs/02413.wav|Which other parts of the body are affected?
wavs/01354.wav|But it's not gonna last.
wavs/01545.wav|Well it's not that big
wavs/00471.wav|Year of inception of the insurance
wavs/00831.wav|I should really get back to work.
wavs/06791.wav|I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.
wavs/00517.wav|which makes it so much harder.
wavs/03153.wav|And cut!
wavs/03065.wav|Why? Why would I? Why? I don't know. Maybe low self esteem?
wavs/06727.wav|Now at length there began a throbbing in her bosom.
wavs/03894.wav|They refused; and they were sentenced to be drowned.
wavs/00254.wav|What basis was used for the calculation?
wavs/03864.wav|Would you like better a man who let his notions lie curled up?
wavs/03160.wav|If I do this for her brother
wavs/01273.wav|Have you undergone a meniscus surgery or?
wavs/03229.wav|But you know what? Just for fun
wavs/03997.wav|The virtues of the wise are of fine brass. Still, something must be done.
wavs/00361.wav|It's the Statue of Liberty! Right! Where's the Statue of Liberty? There.
wavs/02255.wav|I suddenly had the feeling I was falling.
wavs/04236.wav|Bud had never lived in fear of the law.
wavs/05765.wav|Things which comprehend one another must needs be similar.
wavs/04133.wav|Would they all be even living? They began.
wavs/00356.wav|It's a totally different situation. I gotta go.
wavs/05712.wav|Mrs. Jim Mann is taking care of her.
wavs/02418.wav|Excuse me? Joey omnipotent.
wavs/01089.wav|All right. Well there you go.
wavs/01722.wav|Like chasing their tail.
wavs/05139.wav|And forthwith there was summoned a Council of War.
wavs/03922.wav|If more there is to learn, you shall learn it.
wavs/00809.wav|Yeah. Yeah, I do.
wavs/05261.wav|I didn't know what to do. I complained that she had abandoned me.
wavs/01618.wav|I don't think we need a third. Could we get an egg, still in the shell?
wavs/03045.wav|Oh my God
wavs/01401.wav|I always get this strong Debbie vibe
wavs/02272.wav|How often do you or have you had symptoms?
wavs/04749.wav|And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him.
wavs/04149.wav|The eye of reason may pry in upon us.
wavs/00834.wav|No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
wavs/04657.wav|Put in some magazines, too, and the collars.
wavs/04008.wav|I have called him a boy. How warm it is!
wavs/05992.wav|To tell the truth, he had not heard her.
wavs/05643.wav|Call them "angels," and you are in touch with old religious thought. I have just seen Eustace leaving that house.
wavs/06160.wav|Is there such a thing as hereditary LOVE as well?
wavs/05203.wav|And I rode on quietly.
wavs/03940.wav|How should that be? It shuts with a spring.
wavs/02249.wav|You see, he's The Prince. They had some big ceremony before I was born.
wavs/00904.wav|Be right there. Be back in a second. I dumped him.
wavs/00429.wav|So I thought I'd come down here and make sure you were okay. I'm okay.
wavs/06099.wav|She hesitated, smiled uneasily, and came to a full stop.
wavs/01727.wav|Oh right. Just give me another chance.
wavs/03936.wav|You see I can speak generously even of a slave! They can't happen.
wavs/01607.wav|This is so exciting! You can spot someone who's never seen his plays.
wavs/01202.wav|Only child right? How did you know that? It's textbook.
wavs/01212.wav|Please indicate, your activity is related to
wavs/00777.wav|They feel the thing. I don't feel the thing. Honey you should always
wavs/01125.wav|A little. A lot.
wavs/03770.wav|The day was yet young when they WENT their ways.
wavs/02105.wav|Oh you left your hair at my place.
wavs/03780.wav|Try! Well, I had just succeeded in some ruse worthy of the stage.
wavs/05216.wav|Grace looked from one of THEM to the other.
wavs/02256.wav|Yes it's working. Why isn't she calling back?
wavs/02543.wav|Hi Joey. Very nice.
wavs/02682.wav|Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry. It's about me. And I just
wavs/04274.wav|Meat, and the poorest, was very seldom on the table.
wavs/00897.wav|Do you participate in competitions with historic cars only?
wavs/06198.wav|Mary, she is not like her cousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain.
wavs/06531.wav|If you'd like to see what I got for my essay, I'll show you.
wavs/03700.wav|We two against the world!
wavs/03800.wav|This bee has a boring tool, too. They were too astute for that.
wavs/02352.wav|And you got lenses.
wavs/05053.wav|Saxon had known this chest of drawers all her life.
wavs/05501.wav|Fortunately she showed signs of becoming extraordinarily attached to the puppies.
wavs/01594.wav|Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.
wavs/01519.wav|Big day.
wavs/00836.wav|Okay next word would be
wavs/05392.wav|Will you we show our title to the crown?
wavs/00005.wav|Don't you see what you're doing?
wavs/00335.wav|So whose friend are you?
wavs/00541.wav|I know we both said some things
wavs/02213.wav|Nah not so much.
wavs/04306.wav|It is astonishing that people get used to it, and like it too!
wavs/02554.wav|When was it last?
wavs/06672.wav|You were best to call them GENERALLY, man by man, according to the scrip.
wavs/06725.wav|The high slope retreated out of sight behind the nearer protection.
wavs/02795.wav|What are you talking about? Keep it!
wavs/03340.wav|He was positive of it this time, and of its locality as well.
wavs/01301.wav|Just a moment, let me see if she's in. Hello.
wavs/04620.wav|How can I help? To my lady? But where will it take us?
wavs/04077.wav|He was BESIEGED by creditors.
wavs/00950.wav|Date night! Saturday night. Saturday night! No plans, huh? Not a one!
wavs/04485.wav|Pleasant, but wrong, will you say? That was the way right along: I was making scandal; I brought them there to dinner; I let Bella in!
wavs/02509.wav|I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
wavs/02449.wav|Which consequences did you suffer from?
wavs/01848.wav|What?! What kind of relationship do you imagine us having
wavs/06441.wav|Yes, he replied. A Porta shall never be my son; that is my decree.
wavs/00208.wav|When did you last suffer from these symptoms?
wavs/04565.wav|I don't want you to talk about me.
wavs/05997.wav|At the same moment the noise of rolling wheels became audible on the drive.
wavs/04776.wav|Oh, that is false. Of what parents? Do you think that all die out?
wavs/06739.wav|I don't wish to know.
wavs/04292.wav|But then I like fish; and the fast was made for men who like meat.
wavs/01597.wav|to have something else to do? Hello!
wavs/01413.wav|I don't think this was it. I don't think you just get one. I believe things are gonna happen for you. I do.
wavs/06712.wav|Having no other food, she killed the two horses, and smoked their flesh.
wavs/02895.wav|Like all of them?
wavs/03139.wav|What are you doing? I want you to have it. I don't want it.
wavs/03428.wav|Knowing him, as you and I know him, can we wonder at it?
wavs/01328.wav|I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me.
wavs/01241.wav|That's a good one!
wavs/06817.wav|Protection against domestic violence is added with equal propriety.
wavs/04495.wav|His life as a young man had been wasted.
wavs/02759.wav|How often do you use your medication?
wavs/04421.wav|Neither am I a fool. Isn't it a wonderful morning?
wavs/03944.wav|Its properties cannot be extracted, so far, from the actual composition of the wire.
wavs/04910.wav|I was pale and sad and thinner THAN ever.
wavs/04390.wav|It vanished, leaving sky and ocean and Andalusia.
wavs/00966.wav|You could call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps
wavs/02714.wav|And you knew about this?
wavs/02338.wav|did this! Oh right.
wavs/06771.wav|Every day our relations toward each other grew more strained.
wavs/04992.wav|I should go to find ore, that I might make tools.
wavs/00690.wav|I'd hear, Not not mine. Not not mine. 
wavs/04319.wav|You'd pinch the rolls with your tongs and probably get your neck broke.
wavs/05610.wav|I don't know the story of their wooing.
wavs/01914.wav|Wanna join us? No, I'm fine.
wavs/01249.wav|Look who's up! How do you feel?
wavs/01628.wav|Still, it's just such reckless spending.
wavs/06264.wav|Have the factitious and conventional laws tended to that object and accomplished that aim?
wavs/04939.wav|We were POSITIVELY an assembly of insects during thunder.
wavs/06214.wav|He stopped short, but Myles understood him well enough.
wavs/01049.wav|Which other symptoms or complications do you suffer from except to the impaired hearing?
wavs/00346.wav|I know. I know.
wavs/06244.wav|Don't you hear Mr Hay has picked YOU? How may I do it?
wavs/06118.wav|Can you LISTEN to me?
wavs/04775.wav|Subtle speculations: Selby gives examples from questions DISCUSSED by Thomas Aquinas.
wavs/04777.wav|But where there is true friendship there needs none.
wavs/05035.wav|What matter?
wavs/00150.wav|Come on!
wavs/00077.wav|That guy's going home with more than a note. Did I just share too much?
wavs/06126.wav|Squatting in unequal groups they looked at one another scared and without speaking.
wavs/00172.wav|So, in your whole life, you've only been with one? Oh boy. Hockey was a big mistake.
wavs/00086.wav|want them like they're sleeping.
wavs/04947.wav|I'm sure we've always been the best friends.
wavs/04990.wav|Oh, he didn't invent it. Now go to bed.
wavs/05941.wav|Only tell me how I can interest you.
wavs/06429.wav|When these processes take place in regular order the body is in health.
wavs/06417.wav|Mary's heart beat rather quickly: she wondered how far Fred's confidence had gone.
wavs/01590.wav|She was my best friend. See you later. I'll walk with you.
wavs/03971.wav|The volcano on the main island had burst into a state of eruption.
wavs/03525.wav|Did you mean this, dear mistress, as a joke?
wavs/01239.wav|He's so cute! Where did you grow up?
wavs/03109.wav|So how are you doing?
wavs/00767.wav|I don't know what it's for. Nobody knows, and we're not supposed to ask.
wavs/04439.wav|But just returned from a long journey northward.
wavs/01967.wav|Come here. That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
wavs/02647.wav|What do you say?
wavs/00842.wav|Which parts of your body are involved?
wavs/03391.wav|I still looked breathlessly. I can't live without her.
wavs/01203.wav|Have you been treated inpatient for your disorder?
wavs/05710.wav|It was the head of the valley, and beyond it they could not proceed.
wavs/00470.wav|What are you doing? I have no idea.
wavs/06316.wav|A wild tangle of wires was in the street.
wavs/04193.wav|If you are not mad, what are your proofs?
wavs/06807.wav|The question answers itself: Of course not! This tumultuous network of streets was filled with rumors.
wavs/03089.wav|I warned you.
wavs/01814.wav|That would work.
wavs/00636.wav|Hey. Where have you been? I just got back from the vet. Hey he beat you.
wavs/02891.wav|Yeah.
wavs/06707.wav|You may go so far.
wavs/02223.wav|I found it!
wavs/03536.wav|When I was young, as yet I am not old.
wavs/00737.wav|What is your occupation?
wavs/01011.wav|Why is the key person considered valuable?
wavs/05544.wav|Pray much to CHRIST, and little to his saints.
wavs/00409.wav|We're kidding. Tell us. We wanna know. Come on!
wavs/00185.wav|this weekend. Oh that's nice.
wavs/00355.wav|Well Eva
wavs/05108.wav|May I offer my humble congratulations and good wishes?
wavs/04281.wav|Five minutes.
wavs/05138.wav|Don't you be frightened of him, Masters; he's all right.
wavs/00003.wav|Do you still suffer from any symptoms?
wavs/01307.wav|Is your skin problem completely cured?
wavs/02404.wav|It's amazing. We've been back together for what
wavs/03994.wav|What ring?
wavs/04482.wav|There had CERTAINLY been a coolness between them at Brighton.
wavs/04115.wav|Mary nodded and turned her head away again. He is greater than them all!
wavs/05367.wav|The intention wrought its due and immediate effect.
wavs/06468.wav|How can I find out his address in the City?
wavs/05158.wav|Nothing could have been more evident than William's difficulties.
wavs/06249.wav|Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well! But she had to go as far as Cincinnati, either way.
wavs/00404.wav|I'm fine.
wavs/04022.wav|They do not understand; and they shall perish, Utterly perish in their own corruption.
wavs/04933.wav|And he called me to come further. Wrong, wrong, wrong.
wavs/03693.wav|He was thirty years old and was a great sailor.
wavs/04435.wav|Did you know of her coming here? Nancy hesitated.
wavs/03365.wav|"No," said Tarzan, "it is not our lion; it is another lion and he is hunting."
wavs/06421.wav|All right then, if that's what you want.
wavs/02293.wav|No that's not exactly what I was
wavs/00763.wav|I'm fine. I'm fine. Are you sure? Are you sure you're okay? Yeah.
wavs/05928.wav|Rod, Rod!
wavs/00983.wav|Which other radiation?
wavs/06446.wav|Let us make peace. Should I have feared?
wavs/04635.wav|In a short time the Cabal was no more.
wavs/04187.wav|It has been in my mind continually since this happened.
wavs/03684.wav|Why didn't she try to wake him up!
wavs/01371.wav|Right right. Shut up. You just gotta do it. I know. But it's just so hard.
wavs/03116.wav|When did you first suffer symptoms or when was the surgery done?
wavs/05290.wav|Dining at the Mansion House.
wavs/03991.wav|Exactly beneath her stood Bonaparte.
wavs/03261.wav|Cushions the blow.
wavs/02730.wav|Do you have any ongoing symptoms?
wavs/00988.wav|You know what? You know what? Every day you are becoming more and more like your mother.
wavs/01453.wav|You have to give them something.
wavs/03036.wav|Please specify which injury do you suffer from
wavs/02060.wav|Did you ever have a medical treatment caused by radiation damage?
wavs/00854.wav|What liabilities arise on the death of the Proposed Insured?
wavs/05878.wav|But he was off on a preceding speculation.
wavs/01102.wav|Have you drank in the past?
wavs/01002.wav|No. The vet said unless he's in a place
wavs/03042.wav|How many moles have been removed?
wavs/02162.wav|How are you? I am fantastic. Now.
wavs/06215.wav|And it wasn't that George Washington couldn't tell a lie.
wavs/00783.wav|Go! Go! Here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore.
wavs/04669.wav|You love, then, a little?
wavs/06518.wav|Are you rich? You've got no quarrel with this old fellow, have you?
wavs/06464.wav|The horse stopped also, or rather proceeded at a walk.
wavs/06388.wav|What is this unfavorable result to be ascribed to?
wavs/03657.wav|I positively refuse to be frightened out of my wits.
wavs/01296.wav|Do you have any further deformations?
wavs/05539.wav|Fatal! The aggressive TONE was too much for my endurance.
wavs/03883.wav|The French style of play commends itself to me very highly.
wavs/06598.wav|He gave a satisfied little chuckle as he did so.
wavs/01142.wav|because it involves a lot of being normal
wavs/01187.wav|You got away from me.
wavs/05272.wav|The individual may profitably be considered as the "atom" of society.
wavs/02243.wav|I'm sorry so we is? My husband.
wavs/02333.wav|I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
wavs/00235.wav|Her name's Ronni.
wavs/06692.wav|Is it not Abraham Lincoln who has cleared the title to our democracy?
wavs/04887.wav|Then a long wrangle began.
wavs/06688.wav|They did not know the sciences they dealt with.
wavs/06370.wav|Yet farther up is the town of Gibraltar.
wavs/01400.wav|you got to give him something. He's in.
wavs/04287.wav|Come, Tom!
wavs/01297.wav|How's it going? Yeah, right. No, no, really.
wavs/06829.wav|Not here; to divide our own custom. I have never been attached to him.
wavs/05931.wav|The cobbler meekly bowed his head; "She is," came struggling from his throat Scarce audibly.
wavs/02706.wav|Come on, you guys. Tell me all the dirt. Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar.
wavs/04259.wav|Advice to a young actor.
wavs/03588.wav|Lots of clever people have done harm and been wicked.
wavs/01731.wav|I mean if she was here right now
wavs/01174.wav|and I finally get my shot, and I blow it! Maybe this wasn't your shot.
wavs/00474.wav|Are you fully recovered and returned to work?
wavs/03264.wav|I think they're great. I really do.
wavs/04551.wav|Shall I say yes, then?
wavs/00467.wav|Well this is fascinating.
wavs/06158.wav|I am out of work.
wavs/06335.wav|To have the trouble of looking after a sick woman is not pleasant.
wavs/01299.wav|yes I am. I am. I've kind of been waiting for the right person.
wavs/06462.wav|He turned upon his bed in the warm Indian night.
wavs/05894.wav|Who may say? Now listen, kid. It has descended from father to son.
wavs/01201.wav|This guy's why I became an actor.
wavs/00486.wav|Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend, Brian, from Payroll? He is.
wavs/00299.wav|Oh please!
wavs/06581.wav|The leaders are hugging the wall like nestling doves.
wavs/00814.wav|In which countries? When? Duration?
wavs/05819.wav|One family!
wavs/03239.wav|I'll try to get back as soon as I can.
wavs/03023.wav|I'd never have gotten to sing
wavs/06509.wav|Assuredly he would have run the risk and opened the door. Marry again?
wavs/00955.wav|without feeling obligated to one another?
wavs/02655.wav|I don't get it. A month ago, these people were my friends.
wavs/00934.wav|You two, stop it. She gets a credit. I'm in there too.
wavs/05116.wav|He left me, but I didn't know. You come to me.
wavs/00611.wav|That was my agent. That's great! What's the part?
wavs/06633.wav|Suppose we question the porter?
wavs/05424.wav|Mercenary?
wavs/06628.wav|What was the woman like?
wavs/01312.wav|You're sitting there with her. She has no idea.
wavs/00244.wav|What do you mean? Oh I'm so sorry.
wavs/01111.wav|really, really It's time to stop, you look perfect.
wavs/03748.wav|Two straw mats laid upon planks did duty as beds.
wavs/06469.wav|I expect all these ladies want their tea.
wavs/05954.wav|They speak in low tones; they drop their eyes; they toil.
wavs/05811.wav|I was feeling reckless and I wrote recklessly.
wavs/03107.wav|Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
wavs/00975.wav|You're kidding. Oh my God. And on my way over here, I stepped in gum.
