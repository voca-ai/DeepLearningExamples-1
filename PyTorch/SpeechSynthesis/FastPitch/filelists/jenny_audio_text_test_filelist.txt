wavs/05875.wav|Practical exercises. This is a worse sorrow than to have one's husband die.
wavs/02865.wav|But I figure that shouldnt change anything. What does it matter how old we are?
wavs/06767.wav|On the present occasion, this must have been in part, at least, assumed.
wavs/06047.wav|The coachman shall be instantly sent away, Mr. Noel.
wavs/02247.wav|Boys? We're going in. Hi.
wavs/06023.wav|She got up and walked across to her husband.
wavs/02539.wav|All right. Show's over.
wavs/04767.wav|To be there seemed almost too good to be true.
wavs/02187.wav|All right! You guys, it's starting to snow.
wavs/00588.wav|Which respiratory complaints do you suffer from or did you suffer from in the last five years?
wavs/04011.wav|I ain't going. Was it William that she really addressed?
wavs/01502.wav|Oh, no, me. I am so sorry.
wavs/04426.wav|What lady was he with?
wavs/03777.wav|They would have to mind their p's and q's.
wavs/01833.wav|What lung function test did you have? When and what were the results?
wavs/04091.wav|I don't think you mean that. A peach!
wavs/05523.wav|It was a page that was closed. Would he peer into the darkness?
wavs/04409.wav|But it's all so funny. I will, my lord.
wavs/05509.wav|But the thing happens; the husband and father breaks his leg or his neck.
wavs/00302.wav|Do you suffer from any other symptoms or complications caused by this disorder or are other organs involved?
wavs/06014.wav|Lapham groaned.
wavs/00269.wav|Mindy the guy is the devil! He is Satan in a smock!
wavs/02007.wav|Does she? No. Yes, it is. Carol, hi!
wavs/02784.wav|Was a follow-up smear normal?
wavs/05160.wav|Oh, what a comfort a light can be! Six months more wilderness now.
wavs/00648.wav|Let's get started.
wavs/06535.wav|I thought you were sick, of course, but you don't seem to be.
wavs/02833.wav|Are you taking any treatment?
wavs/06569.wav|Even if we would be I'd take this chance to get her out.
wavs/02849.wav|Don't you have to pee? That's why I'm dancing. Hey you.
wavs/03670.wav|I wish I was well rid of her.
wavs/05604.wav|The turn of the tide came, before my cigar was finished.
wavs/06595.wav|He was in twenty different minds about the Diamond in as many minutes.
wavs/00885.wav|to find one of you people. God! Come on. Just do it.
wavs/05885.wav|Do you dislike Oxford? This, at the time, puzzled and grieved me a lot.
wavs/00642.wav|That's it? Yeah it was really hard.
wavs/01280.wav|Oh, no. Not in my room. I'll get him.
wavs/03420.wav|Ah, I see YOUR shame.
wavs/05883.wav|So far as outward appearances were concerned, no impression was produced upon her.
wavs/06702.wav|I'm going on and you're going with me, Cole, like a sensible chap!
wavs/01305.wav|Don't say it! In Love with you.
wavs/05606.wav|He gave her no answer.
wavs/06229.wav|Nowhere else is the sun served with such a word.
wavs/04098.wav|And I hung his key on the nail!
wavs/02603.wav|that's it. Then I'm here talking to you, and it's easy and it's fun.
wavs/03418.wav|Oh for one good draught, even if it should exhaust the whole supply!
wavs/03482.wav|There are three or four more of his like.
wavs/01778.wav|Hey this
wavs/01440.wav|I was falling.
wavs/00781.wav|In what type of Rally do you participate?
wavs/03970.wav|He broke off one end of it and stuck it in his mouth.
wavs/05383.wav|He had been staying with a distant relative.
wavs/02371.wav|What do or did you smoke?
wavs/04448.wav|It was like the first smile of spring.
wavs/01820.wav|Hi sorry I'm late.
wavs/05850.wav|Mamma had to be at the funeral service.
wavs/03271.wav|Did you tell her I wasn't? No. It's because I wanted to go out with her too.
wavs/06377.wav|"No," said he, "a young girl is not thus abandoned, when she has a dowry of a million, unless for some good reason." I am, Tom.
wavs/05857.wav|Absolutely! There was always something about Jane that attracted men.
wavs/04430.wav|But Solomon was right; there is no second chance, not for most of us.
wavs/03210.wav|I told everybody about this! Maybe this wasn't it.
wavs/03674.wav|I thought you merely did not wish to know anything.
wavs/00553.wav|Yes! Yes, I did. But what I didn't say. What I wanted to say was
wavs/06440.wav|And then began the search.
wavs/01918.wav|What is this? You've been so good for three years!
wavs/00318.wav|Because now everything's screwed up.
wavs/04558.wav|It was a night of almost equal suffering to both.
wavs/03060.wav|he's just gonna get vicious. But that may just be a pipe dream. He's out of state.
wavs/03964.wav|Here COMES my father. He darkened the room completely.
wavs/06332.wav|The apology is inadequate. Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat.
wavs/05277.wav|Hang your gratitude! Never mind, I know YOUR friends.
wavs/04666.wav|In spite of men's hateful modern costume, you see he has a leg.
wavs/04192.wav|He started impulsively to his feet, and looked at me.
wavs/01579.wav|I just needed to know
wavs/02232.wav|I hit her in the eye! In the eye!
wavs/05763.wav|The hereditary principle is good, because it is founded on fact and nature.
wavs/01627.wav|Who is being loud? Do I sense a bit of resentment?
wavs/00729.wav|Do you currently smoke?
wavs/01965.wav|Which joints of your body are involved?
wavs/02087.wav|Come on, push me. No. Push me. We're gonna get in trouble.
wavs/05554.wav|He was as bad a correspondent as I am myself.
wavs/00242.wav|With Carol? Oh.
wavs/05350.wav|I am sure your dress must make you feel ill.
wavs/01446.wav|Go for a drink sometime? Sure sounds good.
wavs/00386.wav|Listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity. Me?
wavs/05822.wav|She looked behind her sharply.
wavs/01812.wav|You're gonna lose your job. This is not you.
wavs/01911.wav|They wanna see if you're okay.
wavs/04216.wav|The white man's duties are in his mind clearly defined.
wavs/05110.wav|He reaches great heights and sinks to awful depths.
wavs/02025.wav|And I'm an orthodontist.
wavs/05645.wav|Andre asked no further question, but took his father's hand.
wavs/06072.wav|No one can. Do not swear at all.
wavs/06537.wav|This is that dreadful fever which frightens me so.
wavs/05901.wav|And could you tell me what everyone knows about it?
wavs/01947.wav|Let me just change. Trouble?
wavs/05337.wav|But the keys, the keys!
wavs/05692.wav|They set off once more in the direction of the Bastille.
wavs/02941.wav|This is where you'd use that hello word.
wavs/01474.wav|Who is it? Alan.
wavs/06600.wav|And the servants struck him WITH the palms their hands.
wavs/02056.wav|Happy birthday, pal! We love you, man. It's funny. My birthday was seven months ago.
wavs/03862.wav|The younger one went on. On your own account don't!
wavs/01868.wav|Sorry the first guy runs the lips.
wavs/02897.wav|What was the cause of the anaemia?
wavs/04260.wav|Only a few old men could remember the last meeting of the States General.
wavs/05460.wav|At that time we men all uncovered, and mostly kept at a distance.
wavs/06613.wav|But my boy will grab it as it comes back.
wavs/03671.wav|Her voice was delicious; her bow, as she left me, was the perfection of unaffected grace.
wavs/01321.wav|It's my bank.
wavs/00569.wav|A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world. So? So they still seem normal.
wavs/02792.wav|What was that?
wavs/02990.wav|You're right. They're nice guys!
wavs/05829.wav|I can't keep a single possession to myself.
wavs/00083.wav|It's going pretty good. It's nice and we're having fun.
wavs/06599.wav|Let the lover breathe his vows to the Shades.
wavs/05947.wav|After all, it may have BEEN somebody else.
wavs/01327.wav|Look what I just found on the floor. What?
wavs/04998.wav|Horace tried to compose her.
wavs/05613.wav|You have known me since some ten years, I think; and I have known you.
wavs/06433.wav|The taking of a queen requires a human offering!
wavs/03742.wav|You have been giving him bread; you want to kill your husband, I suppose?
wavs/01078.wav|What is up with the universe?!
wavs/06683.wav|Sufficient for the day be its own evil.
wavs/00492.wav|What do you think of the guys? Our guys? Yeah, our guys. I feel funny talking about that.
wavs/06281.wav|Think I'll take an interest in municipal doings.
wavs/05758.wav|This morning! And Billy suffered her to kiss him again.
wavs/04762.wav|I set myself to consider what I should say next.
wavs/04969.wav|Could they have won it on their own play?
wavs/02455.wav|Oh my God! There's really money in here. I know.
wavs/01560.wav|I know there'll be moments
wavs/06616.wav|More silence. All the same, this Hague Conference is a most mysterious affair.
wavs/06799.wav|Are you listening to me? She was jealous of her.
wavs/02689.wav|Have you ever used recreational or become reliant on any form of drug?
wavs/06409.wav|The young man set his jaw a trifle harder.
wavs/00774.wav|Wow!
wavs/06341.wav|She is younger than you.
wavs/04314.wav|And is not this an honourable spoil, A gallant prize?
wavs/00589.wav|Do you still have symptoms due to the disorder?
wavs/05985.wav|It had neither door, nor window, nor floor.
wavs/05044.wav|In his hand a bunch of blossoms Filling all the lodge with sweetness.
wavs/03592.wav|Treat your body properly and it will treat you properly.
wavs/05515.wav|Oh, how OFTEN have I wished to see him.
wavs/04256.wav|There alone could lovers see each other and communicate.
wavs/06458.wav|It was cold and the neighbors were cruel.
wavs/04522.wav|We know that we are somewhere on the mainland of the Shetland Isles.
wavs/03937.wav|Life with a man is more businesslike after it, and money matters work better.
wavs/03818.wav|That she will have to do. I am der man.
wavs/01839.wav|He threw some feces. If you're working late, I can look in on him.
wavs/04459.wav|Now was Christian somewhat in amaze. The chair put up a warning hand.
wavs/02761.wav|They take their time. They get the job done. They say that you can't change your parents.
wavs/02465.wav|Peaches? Actually, nectarines but. Could've been a peach.
wavs/04002.wav|From me!
wavs/06269.wav|I'm to put it into shape when he's done the translation.
wavs/03424.wav|Not dying, like me? Who is it, Morrison?
wavs/03581.wav|For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe me also: for he wrote of me.
wavs/06680.wav|My neighbours is all poor and has big families.
wavs/05701.wav|The seat was lost, after all, by a narrow majority.
wavs/06330.wav|Breathlessly I put the question; his answer was reassuring.
wavs/05270.wav|Massa Tom!
wavs/01149.wav|I don't know if it's your kind of thing
wavs/05478.wav|The fact is, that job I was speaking to you about was simply this.
wavs/01234.wav|Hello, dear!
wavs/02456.wav|What other activity do you do? Please indicate the annual frequency and participation in championships, etc.
wavs/04275.wav|The Source must be found again and reopened.
wavs/04755.wav|And that brings me BACK to the robbery.
wavs/06025.wav|I have the sacred word of the Sovereigns.
wavs/06579.wav|If I only had your reputation and your prospects!
wavs/05849.wav|No one could surpass Julio in the quick slap and the ready card.
wavs/06694.wav|I THOUGHT it would be fun to brighten the place up a bit.
wavs/06662.wav|I am not aware that anybody wants to fight me.
wavs/02786.wav|Okay coming.
wavs/04383.wav|Is the giving of the names of streams to both of them purely accidental?
wavs/04218.wav|All has turned out splendidly. He is still a fugitive.
wavs/04108.wav|I wonder you are not ashamed to acknowledge it!
wavs/02679.wav|What is or was the treatment?
wavs/01426.wav|Come on he's not that bad. You're wrong! Why would I marry her
wavs/04049.wav|The man said, No. Hawthorne is almost alone in his command of BOTH kinds.
wavs/05560.wav|I am far from denying that this is a distinction of peculiar importance.
wavs/06141.wav|She was now altogether as eager to wean little Gerard.
wavs/04975.wav|When you have slain all the gossips in this town, can we eat them?
wavs/00633.wav|Have you been unable to work in the last ten years because of your disorder or symptoms?
wavs/00241.wav|Which authorisations do you have?
wavs/04846.wav|Mine is a misery which nothing can do away.
wavs/02426.wav|Does your job include any occupational hazards
wavs/02620.wav|You'd think you would've known that. You'd think I would've. It's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
wavs/01261.wav|When did you first suffer symptoms?
wavs/05683.wav|I won't have you work. What's Lin, or you, or anything to me?
wavs/02309.wav|What other treatment have you had?
wavs/05530.wav|She had one FIXED idea.
wavs/02420.wav|Do you suffer from any complications?
wavs/05873.wav|He led the way round the corner of the alley. Pray, your pardon.
wavs/04845.wav|She was far too genuine a woman to do anything of the sort.
wavs/06811.wav|Let me prove this. Sara turned toward her.
wavs/04043.wav|A word from me brings him to my bedside.
wavs/03129.wav|How long do your symptoms last on average?
wavs/06624.wav|He looked upon this winning creature and felt his first thrill of romance.
wavs/01751.wav|Have you completely recovered from your disorder?
wavs/02642.wav|State disorders in the family
wavs/01208.wav|Can I stay? No.
wavs/03739.wav|It had all come of reading heathen works exclusively.
wavs/04889.wav|The work was incomplete, I admit: we demolished the ancient REGIME in deeds; we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas.
wavs/03806.wav|Marius stiffened himself in advance. The woman tied it up in sullen silence.
wavs/04901.wav|A blow injures groups of nerve cells and consciousness disappears; when they recover, it returns.
wavs/01067.wav|Except for. No. Everyone.
wavs/02323.wav|Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
wavs/06091.wav|But, to any mind, I thought, the connection here was clear and straight.
wavs/01226.wav|You got me.
wavs/02287.wav|and not even care. Saturday night. The big night!
wavs/01707.wav|You just have to put the quarter in and it just goes.
wavs/05280.wav|It was not a dream. You'll never go back!
wavs/05868.wav|If your Highness says the word, he shall pass.
wavs/01326.wav|Which other education do you have?
wavs/00339.wav|Why is it unfair? So I have a flaw! Big deal!
wavs/02009.wav|When did you undergo surgery or laser?
wavs/00484.wav|Which diving certificates do you hold?
wavs/06187.wav|Now, while we speak of her? WHAT fellow?
wavs/01912.wav|Is or are the stones still present?
wavs/02994.wav|I've been honing.
wavs/06303.wav|Are you really such a fool as to die rather than hold your tongue?
wavs/05679.wav|But still his speed increased. Now go, dear.
wavs/06770.wav|Spiritual vessel. Ah, that, I hardly doubt, was my fancy!
wavs/00434.wav|Careful. They haven't quite taken yet.
wavs/04499.wav|It's Mr. Pendleton, you know.
wavs/00901.wav|Which kind of benefit? Why did you claim for?
wavs/06650.wav|Do you think we're millionaires?
wavs/04376.wav|Chlorine or iodine will produce the same result.
wavs/04062.wav|What can I do to help you, Henry.
wavs/04841.wav|When did I refuse to share your poverty?
wavs/06568.wav|She'll think we were against her from the beginning.
wavs/00961.wav|or I'll end up like my mom!
wavs/06808.wav|She shook her head calmly.
wavs/04993.wav|We do not want conquests.
wavs/06302.wav|They turned again into the narrow streets amid the darkness.
wavs/05334.wav|But what do you think?
wavs/01279.wav|Please describe your other occupational status
wavs/02148.wav|Doesn't that make me seem? You obviously saw my personal ad.
wavs/06048.wav|Infirm of purpose! Do not offer wicked gifts, for such he will not receive.
wavs/03282.wav|Here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore.
wavs/01592.wav|I can't believe I'm even considering this.
wavs/01599.wav|Why can't we just talk, laugh and make love
wavs/03180.wav|I wish things were different.
wavs/02203.wav|How does she do that?
wavs/04662.wav|Maybe that's what Gale did when he called.
wavs/00074.wav|Out here with me bunking up.
wavs/05111.wav|I will kiss your HAND, and so leave you.
wavs/04483.wav|I want to earn my wages, you know.
wavs/04637.wav|This life has a morrow.
wavs/00013.wav|Keep the change.
wavs/04340.wav|She hesitated; she knew not what to do.
wavs/01392.wav|How often per year do your activities include underground explosions?
wavs/05359.wav|And he who has learned music a musician?
wavs/01081.wav|Are you sure you're okay? Yeah.
wavs/05588.wav|Sit DOWN and compose yourself. How is it worse?
wavs/01835.wav|It's true. Who am I?
wavs/01293.wav|Has your Doctor recommended you too diet or reduce your alcohol consumption?
wavs/05087.wav|The tranquillity of the hour is the tranquillity of Death.
wavs/00033.wav|I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with
wavs/03673.wav|When do the performances in the schoolroom begin? A Plain before the Castle.
wavs/06587.wav|We permit them even in our own House of Commons.
wavs/01514.wav|Notice, no fear. No sense of impending doom. We came on the wrong night.
wavs/01320.wav|Are people eating my dip? Yes.
wavs/00903.wav|What date were you discharged from your inpatient stay?
wavs/02112.wav|What are you doing tomorrow night? That depends on how tonight goes. About tonight Don't you bail on me!
wavs/00956.wav|They take like
wavs/06221.wav|Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.
wavs/06606.wav|Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.
wavs/02773.wav|Okay. Here we go. There's no room for milk.
wavs/03054.wav|When have you had last skin symptoms?
wavs/05287.wav|Pa had always been dreadfully foolish about babies.
wavs/05408.wav|Besides, he who seeks the end must use the means.
wavs/06407.wav|But it is David's problem, and I cannot take the responsibility of telling you.
wavs/05553.wav|It was deserted as usual.
wavs/00990.wav|He's a senior in college. College?
wavs/03646.wav|She stopped still close to him, touching him.
wavs/06450.wav|He opened the door and went out into the starlight.
wavs/02883.wav|A thing through which you can tinkle
wavs/05555.wav|Where Scotland?
wavs/04968.wav|What is it ails you, this night, Nora Burke?
wavs/00277.wav|I just want it the way it was.
wavs/00746.wav|How long were you off work for?
wavs/04045.wav|The parson does all this.
wavs/00463.wav|Nothing. Oh maybe that's it.
wavs/00506.wav|How often do or did you have symptoms?
wavs/02235.wav|Alan. He was unbelievable.
wavs/02858.wav|Call her. Stop being so testosterone y. Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.
wavs/03600.wav|Quite another thing, as you may judge from this single fact.
wavs/04230.wav|Blanche listened.
wavs/05332.wav|And may a person use them either rightly or wrongly?
wavs/06256.wav|What a life it is that I lead!
wavs/00130.wav|Monica?
wavs/06457.wav|I can almost guarantee you success FROM now on. His shoes are dusty.
wavs/04131.wav|He went out, SLAMMING the door in disgust.
wavs/05215.wav|Confident, yet breathless with expectation, I turned the page.
wavs/06814.wav|But when you have given Him yourself, never, never will He abandon you.
wavs/04060.wav|Do you think you will have any supper this evening?
wavs/03106.wav|Oh David. But what are you gonna do?
wavs/03630.wav|There's a young female lately arrived from Manchester. Apparently, not.
wavs/01292.wav|How often did you suffer from your complaints?
wavs/05066.wav|The officers lighted cigarettes. What does it matter if they do?
wavs/04619.wav|Because this island is full of inimical phenomena.
wavs/02186.wav|Is like a giant pigeon
wavs/04144.wav|What breast so cold that is not warmed here?
wavs/00791.wav|I could live without it.
wavs/02674.wav|All right. All right. Just keep him away from me.
wavs/00715.wav|Really?
wavs/04625.wav|And Jonathan rent his garments, and cast earth upon his head, and prayed.
wavs/05540.wav|She thought of him calmly: he seemed a refuge. He pointed out to her that she knew who he was.
wavs/02143.wav|Is there somebody else? It's just
wavs/04467.wav|Oh, he makes things spin!
wavs/03887.wav|Did your master say anything?
wavs/06619.wav|The growing influence of the speech is testified to in letters from all sections.
wavs/06129.wav|You TALK as if you were an impostor.
wavs/05469.wav|He's sinking, Tom! I do not sail this week. They had belonged to Nimrod.
wavs/05541.wav|I am going to make. An hour later they owned a thousand crowns.
wavs/06066.wav|He brought you to me, and me to you.
wavs/04545.wav|Perhaps I'd better read it.
wavs/00590.wav|Come on. If I go I have to break up with you.
wavs/03425.wav|There was but one course to take now.
wavs/01743.wav|That's fine yeah. Why not take it with you?
wavs/02125.wav|Since when do or did you suffer from your impaired hearing?
wavs/05863.wav|Simon said they said he was a great hand to joke.
wavs/03201.wav|What symptoms do you currently suffer from?
wavs/03540.wav|No; take your oil and pour it into a bottle with water. "Yes, my friend," I said, pressing his hand, "we will save him, if possible."
wavs/04490.wav|He had been left an orphan when he was fresh from a public school.
wavs/01073.wav|Okay, so I'm responsible. I'm organized. Imagine this.
wavs/04087.wav|No damage?
wavs/01314.wav|Yeah? Good for you.
wavs/05362.wav|This man she had never known, or loved.

wavs/01340.wav|He's wearing a sweater. No.
wavs/04613.wav|Where will honour be then? Then what do you suggest?
wavs/06351.wav|I'd be afraid to risk taking her anywhere.

wavs/02828.wav|Which type of aviation do you do?
wavs/02469.wav|They said I acted too much with it.
wavs/00138.wav|You know what? No one will be able to tell.
wavs/04119.wav|There was a stone there.
wavs/06308.wav|No, I don't think I could marry you.
wavs/05525.wav|Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
wavs/00437.wav|Okay. Great! So will you bring the truck?

wavs/02424.wav|Please state the age of person with such a disease

wavs/06061.wav|No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
wavs/06731.wav|And she was quite willing; and we talked.
wavs/00455.wav|Why would you dream that? More importantly
wavs/00383.wav|Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef
wavs/02624.wav|It's a really funny story how this happened. It's all right.
wavs/04789.wav|For the Dauphin, I stand here for him.
wavs/04258.wav|Have you any ambition? Miserable ones! How did you escape?
wavs/05609.wav|As time passed and nothing happened she heaved a sigh.
wavs/04033.wav|The word with which you parted so lightly is the keyword of all life.
wavs/04150.wav|She appealed to Stella. Stop, or I shoot you dead!
wavs/00992.wav|I haven't heard from her in seven months, what else is it about?
wavs/06152.wav|Very well!
wavs/03329.wav|Awful play man!
wavs/00609.wav|And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law. How'd it go?
wavs/03181.wav|And now I feel so stupid.
wavs/02757.wav|When did this treatment commence?
wavs/01580.wav|was my. What?
wavs/05895.wav|How could you manage it? I'll show you how.
wavs/02285.wav|I'm smoking. I'm smoking I'm smoking. Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!

wavs/01021.wav|his head is flopping down Broadway, right?
wavs/00745.wav|Just pointing out the irony.
wavs/06267.wav|I often think of her.

wavs/00058.wav|Can I get an espresso and a latte over here?
wavs/00294.wav|Know what I'd hear with every step I took? Not mine. Not mine. Not mine. 
wavs/05144.wav|Find him if you can! A jungle fire!
wavs/06107.wav|And that's exactly what's happened!
wavs/03166.wav|I know but
wavs/02763.wav|Where did symptoms occur?
wavs/03875.wav|The slide to regulate the focus to the plate holder.
wavs/03208.wav|You're in! Right. Come on. Get back in the game.
wavs/03427.wav|I remember standing in a cathedral "somewhere in France" during the celebration of some special Big Magic. You hurt me!
wavs/00402.wav|Here you go.
wavs/03453.wav|Thrice that!
wavs/01220.wav|Please indicate the disorder or complaint
wavs/00426.wav|I mean, I know this is just a first step, but I hope that someday

wavs/04714.wav|And the mother read the letter to me.
wavs/03388.wav|Joy from that in type we borrow, Which in life gives ONLY sorrow.

wavs/00615.wav|What is you maximum diving depth?
wavs/03480.wav|We seem to be forgetting Milton. There is correct English: that is not slang.
wavs/03859.wav|I've been having a run of hard luck.

wavs/02044.wav|your problem is quite clear. To play with or simply let hang

wavs/03655.wav|Every one is in the family. And the society would not send me again.
wavs/00646.wav|And they are. Hey Chan
wavs/02540.wav|I might be if I had the supplies.
wavs/03152.wav|What's the score? Beautiful!
wavs/03436.wav|However, there was no escape.
wavs/00217.wav|I just
wavs/01358.wav|Oh, it's so late for shall we. She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
wavs/04720.wav|Moreover, FROM that moment she was always my friend.
wavs/05234.wav|Yes, necessarily.
wavs/00679.wav|Look I'm asking a favor here.
wavs/00779.wav|There's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
wavs/01565.wav|I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly statement. 
wavs/03631.wav|Is the story as present to your mind now, as it was then?
wavs/02787.wav|Which gas do you use for diving?
wavs/04941.wav|But that was tough work! But the murderers had not followed the paths.
wavs/00236.wav|Oh my God!

wavs/00485.wav|What do you say? Look please don't go anywhere.
wavs/05007.wav|I know him by the white star on his muzzle.
wavs/02547.wav|I think it's winning. It's insane. She'll love it.
wavs/06607.wav|Unpleasant story to get about in connection with the establishment.
wavs/00274.wav|She told you about that huh?
wavs/03762.wav|So you are her FIRST love. A book?
wavs/01277.wav|Something's in my eye. Could we check it in the light, please?

wavs/05057.wav|She wanted frightfully to be beautiful to him.
wavs/00661.wav|let's see what it looked like in the old spot.
wavs/05285.wav|But now I mean to take another path.
wavs/06218.wav|Contemporary judgment could not, of course, anticipate this culmination of a later generation.
wavs/04378.wav|He passed on, and the street was again desolate.
wavs/05417.wav|The log registers ten knots an hour. I just guess.
wavs/02319.wav|What is the nature of your winter sport activity?
wavs/05726.wav|Somehow or other, stunned and speechless, we lifted ourselves heavily into the opening.
wavs/04695.wav|No, at a proper distance. See over yonder.
wavs/06545.wav|He did not know their address. Come on; tune.

wavs/06343.wav|Again, simple and intelligible enough.

wavs/02019.wav|Please give details of your disorder
wavs/02430.wav|I mean they feel the thing

wavs/00835.wav|She's amazing! Go over to her. She's not with anyone.
wavs/01771.wav|You could make little puppets out of them. And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty!

wavs/03846.wav|Daughter, remember what I told you: if the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
wavs/06746.wav|Then came the question: what did my father abstain from?
wavs/02397.wav|It's just You know they're parents. After a certain point, you gotta let go.
wavs/05047.wav|The insurrection was permanent and masquerade a normal state.
wavs/01700.wav|Even more than I was.
wavs/00016.wav|Sorry. How are things going?
wavs/06139.wav|The other was his SINGULAR dying reference to a rat.
wavs/06210.wav|Why, what did she do? How magnificent was the sight from this height!
wavs/05284.wav|The town seemed to be running over with celebrities.
wavs/01824.wav|Come on, come on, come on. Really?
wavs/01611.wav|Do you plan to have a surgery for your complaints?
wavs/06418.wav|He had the air of some frightened creature approaching his master. "You were born in India," he exclaimed, "were you?"
wavs/04171.wav|But I do not die.
wavs/03190.wav|This is still ruined right?
wavs/01353.wav|Has the treatment finished?
wavs/05733.wav|The conversation dropped at the jest. I can't endure it!
wavs/06570.wav|I instantly covered them from sight with two of my own precious publications.
wavs/05771.wav|I don't know what money looks like in the morning.
wavs/04339.wav|They were at the parting of the ways.
wavs/01924.wav|What happened to the puppet guy? Dad.
wavs/01720.wav|What kind of licence do you hold?
wavs/04798.wav|I called up his paper yesterday, but he hasn't shown up.
wavs/05296.wav|Nothing can resist time, as I am well aware.
